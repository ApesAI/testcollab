It begins near the equator in Africa and flows north to the Mediterranean Sea. A delta is an area near a river’s mouth where the water deposits fine soil called silt. This soil was fertile, which means it was good for growing crops. The red land was the barren desert beyond the fertile region. When the birds arrived, the annual flood waters would soon follow. Then they used a tool called a shaduf to spread the water across the fields. These innovative, or new, techniques gave them more farmland. They were the first to grind wheat into flour and to mix the flour with yeast and water to make dough rise into bread. Egyptians often painted walls white to reflect the blazing heat. Poorer Egyptians simply went to the roof to cool off after sunset. Even during the cool season, chipping minerals out of the rock was miserable work. One ancient painting even shows a man ready to hit a catfish with a wooden hammer. A boomerang is a curved stick that returns to the person who threw it.) The river’s current was slow, so boaters used paddles to go faster when they traveled north with the current. Going south, they raised a sail and let the winds that blew in that direction push them. The Nile provided so well for Egyptians that sometimes they had surpluses, or more goods than they needed. Ancient Egypt had no money, so people exchanged goods that they grew or made. This prosperity made life easier and provided greater opportunities for many Egyptians. For example, some ancient Egyptians learned to be scribes, people whose job was to write and keep records. Some skilled artisans erected stone or brick houses and temples. A few Egyptians traveled to the upper Nile to trade with other Africans. They brought back exotic woods, animal skins, and live beasts. Egyptians created a government that divided the empire into 42 provinces. Many officials worked to keep the provinces running smoothly. Priests followed formal rituals and took care of the temples. Before entering a temple, a priest bathed and put on special linen garments and white sandals. Together, the priests and the ruler held ceremonies to please the gods. By doing so, they hoped to maintain the social and political order. In Egypt, people became slaves if they owed a debt, committed a crime, or were captured in war. Unlike other ancient African cultures, in Egyptian society men and women had fairly equal rights. For example, they could both own and manage their own property. Children in Egypt played with toys such as dolls, animal figures, board games, and marbles. Almost all Egyptians married when they were in their early teens. As in many ancient societies, much of the knowledge of Egypt came about as priests studied the world to find ways to please the gods. Doctors believed that the heart controlled thought and the brain circulated blood, which is the opposite of what is known now. Early Egyptians created a hieroglyphic system with about 700 characters. Legend says a king named Narmer united Upper and Lower Egypt. Some historians think Narmer actually represents several kings who gradually joined the two lands. It combined the red Crown of Lower Egypt with the white Crown of Upper Egypt. When a king died, one of his children usually took his place as ruler. Historians divide ancient Egyptian dynasties into the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Old Kingdom started about 2575 B.C., when the Egyptian empire was gaining strength. In such a case, a rival might drive him from power and start a new dynasty. The first rulers of Egypt were often buried in an underground tomb topped by mud brick. They replaced the mud brick with a small pyramid of brick or stone. It is called a step pyramid because its sides rise in a series of giant steps. He ordered the construction of the largest pyramid ever built. One reason is that the pyramids drew attention to the tombs inside them. Grave robbers broke into the tombs to steal the treasure buried with the pharaohs. Egyptians believed that if a tomb was robbed, the person buried there could not have a happy afterlife. This way, the pharaohs hoped to protect their bodies and treasures from robbers. This was to confuse grave robbers about which passage to take. Tombs were supposed to be the palaces of pharaohs in the afterlife. Mourners filled the tomb with objects ranging from food to furniture that the mummified pharaoh would need. Such activities included growing and preparing food, caring for animals, and building boats. Only a secret tomb built for a New Kingdom pharaoh was ever found with much of its treasure untouched. The dazzling riches found in this tomb show how much wealth the pharaohs spent preparing for the afterlife. This period of Egyptian history is called the Middle Kingdom.\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wu7rAR4IrLev"},"outputs":[],"source":["from summarizer import Summarizer"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":45993,"status":"ok","timestamp":1696321003686,"user":{"displayName":"Shamsudheen SatMarks","userId":"10306487884837993737"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"fDH4hRhwrNo4","outputId":"affb6998-3abc-4be2-e331-7fb87ae36a91"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["The Nile River fed Egyptian civilization for hundreds of years.

is a lot of volcanic activity at divergent plate boundaries in the oceans. For example, many undersea volcanoes are found along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This is a divergent plate boundary that runs north-south through the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. As tectonic plates pull away from each other at a divergent plate boundary, they create deep fissures, or cracks, in the crust. Molten rock, called magma, erupts through these cracks onto Earth’s surface. At the surface, the molten rock is called lava. It cools and hardens, forming rock. Divergent plate boundaries also occur in the continental crust. Volcanoes form at these boundaries, but less often than in ocean crust. That’s because continental crust is thicker than oceanic crust. This makes it more difficult for molten rock to push up through the crust. Many volcanoes form along convergent plate boundaries where one tectonic plate is pulled down beneath another at a subduction zone. The leading edge of the plate melts as it is pulled into the mantle, forming magma that erupts as volcanoes. When a line of volcanoes forms along a subduction zone, they make up a volcanic arc. The edges of the Pacific plate are long subduction zones lined with volcanoes. This is why the Pacific rim is called the “Pacific Ring of Fire.”\n"]}],"source":["file_path = \"volcano.txt\" #other texts in same directory: \"PSLE.txt\", \"hellenkeller.txt\", \"Grade7_electricity.txt\" , \"material.txt\", \"paperboat.txt\"\n","\n","def read_file(file_path):\n","    with open(file_path, 'r') as content_file:\n","        content = content_file.read()\n","        return content\n","\n","text = read_file(file_path)\n","print(text)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-3mm5KwFss0D"},"source":["## Summarize the loaded content.\n","Summarize the loaded content with summa extractive summarizer library.

The SpaceX CEO has in recent months often tweeted in support of Dogecoin, but rarely for Bitcoin.  In a recent tweet, Musk put out a statement from Tesla that it was “concerned” about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin (price in India) mining and transaction, and hence was suspending vehicle purchases using the cryptocurrency.  A day later he again tweeted saying, “To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can't drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal”.  It triggered a downward spiral for Bitcoin value but the cryptocurrency has stabilised since.   A number of Twitter users welcomed Musk's statement.

It begins near the equator in Africa and flows north to the Mediterranean Sea. A delta is an area near a river’s mouth where the water deposits fine soil called silt. This soil was fertile, which means it was good for growing crops. The red land was the barren desert beyond the fertile region. When the birds arrived, the annual flood waters would soon follow. Then they used a tool called a shaduf to spread the water across the fields. These innovative, or new, techniques gave them more farmland. They were the first to grind wheat into flour and to mix the flour with yeast and water to make dough rise into bread. Egyptians often painted walls white to reflect the blazing heat. Poorer Egyptians simply went to the roof to cool off after sunset. Even during the cool season, chipping minerals out of the rock was miserable work. One ancient painting even shows a man ready to hit a catfish with a wooden hammer. A boomerang is a curved stick that returns to the person who threw it.) The river’s current was slow, so boaters used paddles to go faster when they traveled north with the current. Going south, they raised a sail and let the winds that blew in that direction push them. The Nile provided so well for Egyptians that sometimes they had surpluses, or more goods than they needed. Ancient Egypt had no money, so people exchanged goods that they grew or made. This prosperity made life easier and provided greater opportunities for many Egyptians. For example, some ancient Egyptians learned to be scribes, people whose job was to write and keep records. Some skilled artisans erected stone or brick houses and temples. A few Egyptians traveled to the upper Nile to trade with other Africans. They brought back exotic woods, animal skins, and live beasts. Egyptians created a government that divided the empire into 42 provinces. Many officials worked to keep the provinces running smoothly. Priests followed formal rituals and took care of the temples. Before entering a temple, a priest bathed and put on special linen garments and white sandals. Together, the priests and the ruler held ceremonies to please the gods. By doing so, they hoped to maintain the social and political order. In Egypt, people became slaves if they owed a debt, committed a crime, or were captured in war. Unlike other ancient African cultures, in Egyptian society men and women had fairly equal rights. For example, they could both own and manage their own property. Children in Egypt played with toys such as dolls, animal figures, board games, and marbles. Almost all Egyptians married when they were in their early teens. As in many ancient societies, much of the knowledge of Egypt came about as priests studied the world to find ways to please the gods. Doctors believed that the heart controlled thought and the brain circulated blood, which is the opposite of what is known now. Early Egyptians created a hieroglyphic system with about 700 characters. Legend says a king named Narmer united Upper and Lower Egypt. Some historians think Narmer actually represents several kings who gradually joined the two lands. It combined the red Crown of Lower Egypt with the white Crown of Upper Egypt. When a king died, one of his children usually took his place as ruler. Historians divide ancient Egyptian dynasties into the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Old Kingdom started about 2575 B.C., when the Egyptian empire was gaining strength. In such a case, a rival might drive him from power and start a new dynasty. The first rulers of Egypt were often buried in an underground tomb topped by mud brick. They replaced the mud brick with a small pyramid of brick or stone. It is called a step pyramid because its sides rise in a series of giant steps. He ordered the construction of the largest pyramid ever built. One reason is that the pyramids drew attention to the tombs inside them. Grave robbers broke into the tombs to steal the treasure buried with the pharaohs. Egyptians believed that if a tomb was robbed, the person buried there could not have a happy afterlife. This way, the pharaohs hoped to protect their bodies and treasures from robbers. This was to confuse grave robbers about which passage to take. Tombs were supposed to be the palaces of pharaohs in the afterlife. Mourners filled the tomb with objects ranging from food to furniture that the mummified pharaoh would need. Such activities included growing and preparing food, caring for animals, and building boats. Only a secret tomb built for a New Kingdom pharaoh was ever found with much of its treasure untouched. The dazzling riches found in this tomb show how much wealth the pharaohs spent preparing for the afterlife. This period of Egyptian history is called the Middle Kingdom.\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"E_lt6v8myo33"},"outputs":[],"source":["full_text =

This soil was fertile, which means it was good for growing crops. The red land was the barren desert beyond the fertile region. They were the first to grind wheat into flour and to mix the flour with yeast and water to make dough rise into bread. Egyptians often painted walls white to reflect the blazing heat. One ancient painting even shows a man ready to hit a catfish with a wooden hammer. A boomerang is a curved stick that returns to the person who threw it.) This prosperity made life easier and provided greater opportunities for many Egyptians. For example, some ancient Egyptians learned to be scribes, people whose job was to write and keep records. Some skilled artisans erected stone or brick houses and temples. Priests followed formal rituals and took care of the temples. Before entering a temple, a priest bathed and put on special linen garments and white sandals. Together, the priests and the ruler held ceremonies to please the gods. In Egypt, people became slaves if they owed a debt, committed a crime, or were captured in war. Unlike other ancient African cultures, in Egyptian society men and women had fairly equal rights. Children in Egypt played with toys such as dolls, animal figures, board games, and marbles. As in many ancient societies, much of the knowledge of Egypt came about as priests studied the world to find ways to please the gods.

just his tweets. After saying that his electric vehicle-making company Tesla will not accept payments in Bitcoin because of environmental concerns, he tweeted that he was working with developers of Dogecoin to improve system transaction efficiency. Following the two distinct statements from him, the world's largest cryptocurrency hit a two-month low, while Dogecoin rallied by about 20 percent. The SpaceX CEO has in recent months often tweeted in support of Dogecoin, but rarely for Bitcoin.  In a recent tweet, Musk put out a statement from Tesla that it was “concerned” about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin (price in India) mining and transaction, and hence was suspending vehicle purchases using the cryptocurrency.  A day later he again tweeted saying, “To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can't drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal”.  It triggered a downward spiral for Bitcoin value but the cryptocurrency has stabilised since.   A number of Twitter users welcomed Musk's statement. One of them said it's time people started realising that Dogecoin “is here to stay” and another referred to Musk's previous assertion that crypto could become the world's future currency.\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ZYcEqPQl0cyU"},"outputs":[],"source":["text = text1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"LbQHS1li0c4C"},"outputs":[],"source":["text = text2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lEkbIr6n0c_N"},"outputs":[],"source":["text = text3"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yPBBnjolzwkH"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Step 2- Extract the important words(keywords) from the text article that can be used to create MCQ using PKE (Python Keyword Extraction)\n","\n","import pke\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords #Stopwords are the words that we need to avoid while considering keyword extraction\n","import string\n","def getImportantWords(art):\n","    extractor=pke.unsupervised.MultipartiteRank() #Using the Multipartite Unsupervised Extractor as our extractor\n","    extractor.load_document(input=art,language='en')\n","    pos={'PROPN'} #We are only considering proper nouns as valid candidates for our keywords\n","    stops=list(string.punctuation) #Stoplist contains the words to be avoided\n","    stops+=['-lrb-', '-rrb-', '-lcb-', '-rcb-', '-lsb-', '-rsb-'] #These stand for the brackets as in lrb=left round bracket=\"(\" and so on\n","    stops+=stopwords.words('english')\n","    extractor.candidate_selection(pos=pos) #Sets the candidate selection criteria, as in, which should be considered and which should be avoided\n","    extractor.candidate_weighting() #Sets the preference criteria for the candidates\n","    result=[]\n","    ex=extractor.get_n_best(n=25) #Gets the 25 best candidates according to the criteria set\n","    for each in ex:\n","        result.append(each[0])\n","    return result\n","impWords=getImportantWords(text) #Get the important words (keywords) from the text article using the above function\n","#print(impWords)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WnNDvOyzzwkL"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Step 3- Split the whole text article into an array/list of individual sentences.

But  I say there are three, because I’ve been on the third level of the Grand Central  Station. Yes, I’ve taken the obvious step:  I talked to a psychiatrist friend of mine,  among others. I told him about the third  level at Grand Central Station, and he said it was a waking-  dream wish fulfillment. He said I was unhappy. That made  my wife kind of mad, but he explained that he meant the  modern world is full of insecurity, fear, war, worry and all  the rest of it, and that I just want to escape. Well, who  doesn’t? Everybody I know wants to escape, but they don’t  wander down into any third level at Grand Central Station. But that’s the reason, he said, and my friends all agreed. Everything points to it, they claimed. My stamp  collecting, for example; that’s a ‘temporary refuge from  reality.’ Well, maybe, but my grandfather didn’t need any  refuge from reality; things were pretty nice and peaceful. 2Vistas in his day, from all I hear, and he started my collection. It’s a nice collection too, blocks of four of practically every  U.S. issue, first-day covers, and so on. President Roosevelt  collected stamps too, you know. Anyway, here’s what happened at Grand Central. One night last summer I worked late at the office. I was in a hurry to get uptown to my apartment so I decided to take the subway from Grand Central because it’s faster than the bus. Now, I don’t know why this  should have happened to me. I’m just an ordinary guy named Charley,  thirty-one years old, and I was wearing a tan gabardine suit and a straw  hat with a fancy band; I passed a dozen men who looked  just like me. And I wasn’t trying to escape from anything; I  just wanted to get home to Louisa, my wife. I turned into Grand Central from Vanderbilt Avenue, and went down the steps to the first level, where you take  trains like the Twentieth Century. Then I walked down  another flight to the second level, where the suburban trains  leave from, ducked into an arched doorway heading for the  subway — and got lost. That’s easy to do. I’ve been in and  out of Grand Central hundreds of times, but I’m always  bumping into new doorways and stairs and corridors. Once  I got into a tunnel about a mile long and came out in the  lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel. Another time I came up in an  office building on Forty-sixth Street, three blocks away. Sometimes I think Grand Central is growing like a tree, pushing out new corridors and staircases like roots. There’s probably a long tunnel that  nobody knows about  feeling its way under  the city right now, on its  way to Times Square, and  maybe another to Central Park.  And maybe — because for so many  people through the years Grand  Central has been an exit, a way of escape — maybe that’s how the  tunnel I got into... But I never told  my psychiatrist friend about that  idea. The corridor I was in began angling left and slanting downward and  I thought that was wrong, but I kept on  walking. All I could hear was the empty  sound of my own footsteps and I didn’t pass  a soul. Then I heard that sort of hollow roar  ahead that means open space and people  talking. The tunnel turned sharp left; I went  down a short flight of stairs and came out  on the third level at Grand Central Station.  For just a moment I thought I was back on  the second level, but I saw the room was  smaller, there were fewer ticket windows  and train gates, and the information  booth in the centre was wood and old-  looking. And the man in the booth  wore a green eyeshade and  long black sleeve  protectors. The  lights were dim  and sort of  flickering. Then  I saw why; they  were open-flame  gaslights. There were brass spittoons on the floor, and across the station a glint of light caught my eye; a man was pulling a gold watch from his vest pocket. He snapped open the  cover, glanced at his watch and frowned. He wore a derby  hat, a black four-button suit with tiny lapels, and he had  a big, black, handlebar mustache. Then I looked around  and saw that everyone in the station was dressed like  eighteen-ninety-something; I never saw so many beards,  sideburns and fancy mustaches in my life. A woman walked  in through the train gate; she wore a dress with leg-of-  mutton sleeves and skirts to the top of her high-buttoned  shoes. Back of her, out on the tracks, I caught a glimpse of  a locomotive, a very small Currier & Ives locomotive with a  funnel-shaped stack. And then I knew. To make sure, I walked over to a newsboy and glanced at the stack of papers at his feet. It was The World; and The World hasn’t been published for years. The lead story said something about President Cleveland. I’ve found that front page since, in the Public Library files, and it was printed June 11, 1894. I turned toward the ticket windows knowing that here — on the third level at Grand  Central — I could buy tickets that would take Louisa and  me anywhere in the United States we wanted to go. In the  year 1894. And I wanted two tickets to Galesburg, Illinois. Have you ever been there? It’s a wonderful town still, with big old frame houses, huge lawns, and tremendous  trees whose branches meet overhead and roof the streets.  And in 1894, summer evenings were twice as long, and  people sat out on their lawns, the men smoking cigars and  talking quietly, the women waving palm-leaf fans, with  the fire-flies all around, in a peaceful world. To be back  there with the First World War still twenty years off, and  World War II over forty years in the future... I wanted two  tickets for that. The clerk figured the fare — he glanced at my fancy hatband, but he figured the fare — and I had enough for two coach tickets, one way. But when I counted out the  money and looked up, the clerk was staring at me. He  nodded at the bills. ‘‘That ain’t money, mister,’’ he said,  ‘‘and if you’re trying to skin me, you won’t get very far,’’  and he glanced at the cash drawer beside him. Of course  the money was old-style bills, half again as big as the  money we use nowadays, and different-looking. I turned  away and got out fast. There’s nothing nice about jail, even  in 1894. And that was that. I left the same way I came, I suppose. Next day, during  lunch hour, I drew three hundred dollars  out of the bank, nearly all we had, and  bought old-style currency (that really worried my psychiatrist friend). You can  buy old money at almost any coin  dealer’s, but you have to pay a premium.  My three hundred dollars bought less  than two hundred in old-style bills, but I  didn’t care; eggs were thirteen cents a dozen in 1894. But I’ve never again found the corridor that leads to the third level at Grand Central Station, although I’ve tried often enough. Louisa was pretty worried when I told her all this, and didn’t want me to look for the third level any more, and after a while I stopped; I went back to my stamps. But now  we’re both looking, every weekend, because now we have proof that the third level is still there. My friend Sam Weiner  disappeared! Nobody knew where, but I sort of suspected  because Sam’s a city boy, and I used to tell him about  Galesburg — I went to school there — and he always said  he liked the sound of the place. And that’s where he is, all  right. In 1894. Because one night, fussing with my stamp collection, I found — Well, do you know what a first-day cover is?  When a new stamp is issued, stamp collectors buy some 6Vistas and use them to mail envelopes to themselves on the very first day of sale; and the postmark proves the date. The  envelope is called a first-day cover. They’re never opened;  you just put blank paper in the envelope. That night, among my oldest first-day covers, I found one that shouldn’t have been there. But there it was. It  was there because someone had mailed it to my grandfather  at his home in Galesburg; that’s what the address on the  envelope said. And it had been there since July 18, 1894  — the postmark showed that — yet I didn’t remember it at  all. The stamp was a six-cent, dull brown, with a picture  of President Garfield. Naturally, when the envelope came  to Granddad in the mail, it went right into his collection and stayed there — till I took it out and opened it. The paper inside wasn’t blank. It read: 941 Willard Street Galesburg, Illinois July 18, 1894 Charley I got to wishing that you were right. Then I got to believing you were right. And, Charley, it’s true; I found the third level! I’ve been here two weeks, and right now, down the street at the  Daly’s, someone is playing a piano, and they’re all out on the front  porch singing ‘Seeing Nelly Home.’ And I’m invited over for  lemonade. Come on back, Charley and Louisa. Keep looking till you  find the third level! It’s worth it, believe me! 6Vistas and use them to mail envelopes to themselves on the very first day of sale; and the postmark proves the date. The  envelope is called a first-day cover.

At the stamp and coin store I go to, I found out that Sam bought eight hundred dollars’ worth of old-style  currency. That ought to set him up in a nice little hay,  feed and grain business; he always said that’s what he  really wished he could do, and he certainly can’t go back  to his old business.

He may be identified  as His Highness Jamedar-General,  Khiledar-Major, Sata Vyaghra Samhari,  Maharajadhiraja Visva Bhuvana  Samrat, Sir Jilani Jung Jung Bahadur,  M.A.D., A.C.T.C., or C.R.C.K. But this  name is often shortened to the Tiger  King. I have come forward to tell you why he came to be known as Tiger King. I  have no intention of pretending to advance only to end in a  strategic withdrawal. Even the threat of a Stuka bomber  will not throw me off track. The Stuka, if it likes, can beat  a hasty retreat from my story. Right at the start, it is imperative to disclose a matter of vital importance about the Tiger King. Everyone who  reads of him will experience the natural desire to meet a  man of his indomitable courage face-to-face. But there is  no chance of its fulfilment. As Bharata said to Rama about Dasaratha, the Tiger King has reached that final abode of all living creatures. In other words, the Tiger King is dead. The manner of his death is a matter of extraordinary interest. It can be revealed only at the end of the tale. The  most fantastic aspect of his demise was that as soon as he  was born, astrologers had foretold that one day the Tiger  King would actually have to die. “The child will grow up to become the warrior of warriors, hero of heroes, champion of champions. But...”  they bit their lips and swallowed hard. When compelled to  continue, the astrologers came out with it. “This is a secret  which should not be revealed at all. And yet we are forced  to speak out. The child born under this star will one day  have to meet its death.” At that very moment a great miracle took place. An astonishing phrase emerged from the lips of the ten-day-  old Jilani Jung Jung Bahadur, “O wise prophets!’’ Everyone stood transfixed in stupefaction. They looked wildly at each other and blinked. ‘‘O wise prophets! It was I who spoke.’’  This time there were no grounds for doubt. It was the infant born just ten days ago who had enunciated the words  so clearly. The chief astrologer took off his spectacles and gazed intently at the baby. ‘‘All those who are born will one day have to die. We don’t need your predictions to know that. There would be  some sense in it if you could tell us the manner of that  death,’’ the royal infant uttered these words in his little  squeaky voice. The chief astrologer placed his finger on his nose in wonder. A baby barely ten days old opens its lips in speech!  Not only that, it also raises intelligent questions! Incredible!  Rather like the bulletins issued by the war office, than facts. The chief astrologer took his finger off his nose and fixed his eyes upon the little prince. ‘‘The prince was born in the hour of the Bull. The Bull and the Tiger are enemies, therefore, death comes from  the Tiger,’’ he explained. You may think that crown prince Jung Jung Bahadur was thrown into a quake when he heard the word ‘Tiger’. That was exactly what did not happen. As soon as he heard  it pronounced, the crown prince gave a deep growl. Terrifying  words emerged from his lips. ‘‘Let tigers beware!’’  This account is only a rumour rife in Pratibandapuram. But with hindsight we may conclude it was based on some  truth. II Crown prince Jung Jung Bahadur grew taller and stronger day by day. No  other miracle marked his childhood days  apart from the event already described.  The boy drank the milk of an English  cow, was brought up by an English  nanny, tutored in English by an  Englishman, saw nothing but English  films — exactly as the crown princes of  all the other Indian states did. When he came of age at twenty, the State, which had been with the  Court of Wards until then, came into his hands. But everyone in the kingdom remembered the astrologer’s prediction. Many continued to discuss the  matter. Slowly it came to the Maharaja’s ears. There were innumerable forests in the Pratibandapuram State. They had tigers in them. The Maharaja knew the old  saying, ‘You may kill even a cow in self-defence’. There could  certainly be no objection to killing tigers in self-defence.  The Maharaja started out on a tiger hunt. The Maharaja was thrilled beyond measure when he killed his first tiger. He sent for the State astrologer and  showed him the dead beast. ‘‘What do you say now?’’ he demanded.  ‘‘Your majesty may kill ninety-nine tigers in exactly the same manner. But...’’ the astrologer drawled. ‘‘But what? Speak without fear.’’  “But you must be very careful with the hundredth tiger.’’ 11The Tiger King ‘‘What if the hundredth tiger were also killed?’’ ‘‘Then I will tear up all my books on astrology, set fire to them, and...’’ ‘‘And...’’  ‘‘I shall cut off my tuft, crop my hair short and become an insurance agent,’’ the astrologer finished on an  incoherent note. III From that day onwards it was celebration time for all the tigers inhabiting Pratibandapuram. The State banned tiger hunting by anyone except the Maharaja. A proclamation was issued to the effect that if  anyone dared to fling so much as a stone at a tiger, all his  wealth and property would be confiscated. The Maharaja vowed he would attend to all other matters only after killing the hundred tigers. Initially the  king seemed well set to realise his ambition. Not that he faced no dangers. There were times when the bullet missed its mark, the tiger leapt upon him and  he fought the beast with his bare hands. Each time it was  the Maharaja who won. At another time he was in danger of losing his throne. A high-ranking British officer visited Pratibandapuram. He was very fond of hunting tigers. And fonder of being  photographed with the tigers he had shot. As usual, he  wished to hunt tigers in Pratibandapuram. But the  Maharaja was firm in his resolve. He refused permission.  ‘‘I can organise any other hunt. You may go on a boar  hunt. You may conduct a mouse hunt. We are ready for a  mosquito hunt. But tiger hunt! That’s impossible!’’ The British officer’s secretary sent word to the Maharaja through the dewan that the durai himself did not have to kill the tiger. The Maharaja could do the actual  killing. What was important to the durai was a photograph of himself holding the gun and standing over the tiger’s  carcass. But the Maharaja would not agree even to this  proposal. If he relented now, what would he do if other  British officers turned up for tiger hunts? Because he prevented a British officer from fulfilling his desire, the Maharaja stood in danger of losing his  kingdom itself. The Maharaja and the dewan held deliberations over this issue. As a result, a telegram was despatched forthwith  to a famous British company of jewellers in Calcutta. ‘Send  samples of expensive diamond rings of different designs.’ Some fifty rings arrived. The Maharaja sent the whole lot to the British officer’s good lady. The king and the minister  expected the duraisani to choose one or two rings and send the rest back. Within no time at all the duraisani sent her reply: ‘Thank you very much for your gifts.’ In two days a bill for three lakh of rupees came from the British jewellers. The Maharaja was happy that though  he had lost three lakh of rupees, he had managed to retain his kingdom. \"\"\"\n","text1501 = f\"\"\"Dr Sadao Hoki’s house was built on a  spot of the Japanese coast where as a  little boy he had often played. The low,  square stone house was set upon rocks  well above a narrow beach that was  outlined with bent pines. As a boy Sadao  had climbed the pines, supporting  himself on his bare feet, as he had seen  men do in the South Seas when they  climbed for coconuts. His father had  taken him often to the islands of those seas, and never had he failed to say to the little brave boy  at his side, ‘‘Those islands yonder, they are the stepping  stones to the future for Japan.’’ ‘‘Where shall we step from them?’’ Sadao had asked seriously. ‘‘Who knows?’’ his father had answered. ‘‘Who can limit our future? It depends on what we make it.’’ Sadao had taken this into his mind as he did everything his father said, his father who never joked or played with him but who spent infinite pains upon him  who was his only son. Sadao knew that his education was  his father’s chief concern. For this reason he had been  sent at twenty-two to America to learn all that could be  learned of surgery and medicine. He had come back at  thirty, and before his father died he had seen Sadao become  famous not only as a surgeon but as a scientist. Because  he was perfecting a discovery which would render wounds  entirely clean, he had not been sent abroad with the troops.  Also, he knew, there was some slight danger that the old  General might need an operation for a condition for which  he was now being treated medically, and for this possibility  Sadao was being kept in Japan. Clouds were rising from the ocean now. The unexpected warmth of the past few days had at night drawn heavy fog  from the cold waves. Sadao watched mists hide outlines of  a little island near the shore and then come creeping up  the beach below the house, wreathing around the pines.  In a few minutes fog would be wrapped about the house  too. Then he would go into the room where Hana, his wife,  would be waiting for him with the two children. But at this moment the door opened and she looked out, a dark-blue woollen haori1 over her kimono. She came to him affectionately and put her arm through his as he  stood, smiled and said nothing. He had met Hana in  America, but he had waited to fall in love with her until he  was sure she was Japanese. His father would never have  received her unless she had been pure in her race. He  wondered often whom he would have married if he had not  met Hana, and by what luck he had found her in the most  casual way, by chance literally, at an American professor’s  house. The professor and his wife had been kind people  anxious to do something for their few foreign students,  and the students, though bored, had accepted this  kindness. Sadao had often told Hana how nearly he had  not gone to Professor Harley’s house that night — the rooms were so small, the food so bad, the professor’s wife so voluble. But he had gone and there he had found Hana, a  new student, and had felt he would love her if it were at  all possible. Now he felt her hand on his arm and was aware of the pleasure it gave him, even though they had been married  years enough to have the two children. For they had not  married heedlessly in America. They had finished their work  at school and had come home to Japan, and when his  father had seen her the marriage had been arranged in  the old Japanese way, although Sadao and Hana had talked  everything over beforehand. They were perfectly happy. She  laid her cheek against his arm. It was at this moment that both of them saw something black come out of the mists. It was a man. He was flung up out of the ocean — flung, it  seemed, to his feet by a breaker. He staggered a few steps, his body outlined against the mist, his arms above his head. Then the curled mists hid  him again. ‘‘Who is that?’’ Hana cried. She dropped Sadao’s arm and they both leaned over the railing of the veranda. Now they  saw him again. The man was on his hands and knees crawling. Then they saw him fall on his face and lie there. ‘‘A fisherman perhaps,’’ Sadao said, ‘‘washed from his boat.’’ He ran quickly down the steps and behind him 27The Enemy Hana came, her wide sleeves flying. A mile or two away on either side there were fishing villages, but here was only  the bare and lonely coast, dangerous with rocks. The surf  beyond the beach was spiked with rocks. Somehow the  man had managed to come through them — he must be  badly torn. They saw when they came toward him that indeed it was so. The sand on one side of him had already a stain of  red soaking through. ‘‘He is wounded,’’ Sadao exclaimed. He made haste to the man, who lay motionless, his face in the sand. An old  cap stuck to his head soaked with sea water. He was in  wet rags of garments. Sadao stopped, Hana at his side,  and turned the man’s head. They saw the face. “A white man!” Hana whispered.  Yes, it was a white man. The wet cap fell away and there was his wet yellow hair, long, as though for many  weeks it had not been cut, and upon his young and tortured  face was a rough yellow beard. He was  unconscious and knew nothing that they  did for him. Now Sadao remembered the wound, and with his expert fingers he began to  search for it. Blood flowed freshly at his  touch. On the right side of his lower back  Sadao saw that a gun wound had been  reopened. The flesh was blackened with  powder. Sometime, not many days ago,  the man had been shot and had not been  tended. It was bad chance that the rock  had struck the wound. ‘‘Oh, how he is bleeding!’’ Hana whispered again in a solemn voice. The mists screened them now completely,  and at this time of day no one came by. The fishermen had  gone home and even the chance beachcombers would have  considered the day at an end. ‘‘What shall we do with this man?’’ Sadao muttered. But his trained hands seemed of their own will to be doing  what they could to stanch the fearful bleeding. He packed the wound with the sea moss that strewed the beach. The man moaned with pain in his stupor but he did not awaken. ‘‘The best thing that we could do would be to put him back in the sea,’’ Sadao said, answering himself. Now that the bleeding was stopped for the moment he stood up and dusted the sand from his hands. ‘‘Yes, undoubtedly that would be best,’’ Hana said steadily. But she continued to stare down at the motionless  man. ‘‘If we sheltered a white man in our house we should be arrested and if we turned him over as a prisoner, he  would certainly die,’’ Sadao said. ‘‘The kindest thing would be to put him back into the sea,’’ Hana said. But neither of them moved. They were  staring with a curious repulsion upon the inert figure. ‘‘What is he?’’ Hana whispered.  ‘‘There is something about him that looks American,’’ Sadao said. He took up the battered cap. Yes, there, almost  gone, was the faint lettering. ‘‘A sailor,’’ he said, ‘‘from an  American warship.’’ He spelled it out: ‘‘U.S. Navy.’’ The man  was a prisoner of war! ‘‘He has escaped.’’ Hana cried softly, ‘‘and that is why he is wounded.’’ ‘‘In the back,’’ Sadao agreed.  They hesitated, looking at each other. Then Hana said with resolution: “Come, are we able to put him back into the sea?”  “If I am able, are you?” Sadao asked.  “No,” Hana said, “But if you can do it alone...”  Sadao hesitated again. “The strange thing is,” he said, “that if the man were whole I could turn him over to the  police without difficulty. I care nothing for him. He is my  enemy. All Americans are my enemy. And he is only a  common fellow. You see how foolish his face is. But since  he is wounded...” “You also cannot throw him back to the sea,” Hana said. “Then there is only one thing to do. We must carry  him into the house.” “But the servants?” Sadao inquired. 29The Enemy “We must simply tell them that we intend to give him to the police — as indeed we must, Sadao. We must think of the children and your position. It would endanger all of  us if we did not give this man over as a prisoner of war.” “Certainly,” Sadao agreed. “I would not think of doing anything else.”\"\"\"\n","text1400 = f\"\"\"In the evenings and for Saturday naps  like today’s, Jack told his daughter Jo a  story out of his head. This custom,  begun when she was two, was itself now  nearly two years old, and his head felt  empty. Each new story was a slight  variation of a basic tale: a small  creature, usually named Roger (Roger  Fish, Roger Squirrel, Roger Chipmunk),  had some problem and went with it to  the wise old owl. The owl told him to go  to the wizard, and the wizard performed a magic spell that  solved the problem, demanding in payment a number of  pennies greater than the number that Roger Creature had,  but in the same breath directing the animal to a place  where the extra pennies could be found. Then Roger was  so happy he played many games with other creatures, and  went home to his mother just in time to hear the train  whistle that brought his daddy home from Boston. Jack described their supper, and the story was over. Working his way through this scheme was especially fatiguing on  Saturday, because Jo never fell asleep in naps any more,  and knowing this made the rite seem futile. The little girl (not so little any more; the bumps her feet made under the covers were halfway down the bed,  their big double bed that they let her be in for naps and  when she was sick) had at last arranged herself, and from  the way her fat face deep in the pillow shone in the sunlight  sifting through the drawn shades, it did not seem fantastic  that some magic would occur, and she would take her nap  like an infant of two. Her brother, Bobby, was two, and  already asleep with his bottle. Jack asked, “Who shall the  story be about today?” “Roger...” Jo squeezed her eyes shut and smiled to be thinking she was thinking. Her eyes opened, her mother’s  blue. “Skunk,” she said firmly. A new animal; they must talk about skunks at nursery school. Having a fresh hero momentarily stirred Jack to  creative enthusiasm. “All right,” he said. “Once upon a time,  in the deep dark woods, there was a tiny little creature by the name of Roger Skunk. And he smelled very bad.” “Yes,” Jo said.  “He smelled so bad that none of the other little woodland creatures would play with him.” Jo looked at  him solemnly; she hadn’t foreseen this. “Whenever he  would go out to play,” Jack continued with zest,  remembering certain humiliations of his own childhood,  “all of the other tiny animals would cry, “Uh-oh, here comes  Roger Stinky Skunk,” and they would run away, and Roger  Skunk would stand there all alone, and two little round  tears would fall from his eyes.” The corners of Jo’s mouth  drooped down and her lower lip bent forward as he traced  with a forefinger along the side of her nose the course of  one of Roger Skunk’s tears. “Won’t he see the owl?” she asked in a high and faintly roughened voice. Sitting on the bed beside her, Jack felt the covers tug as her legs switched tensely. He was pleased with this moment — he was telling her something true, something she must know — and had no wish to hurry on. But  downstairs a chair scraped, and he realised he must get  down to help Clare paint the living-room woodwork. “Well, he walked along very sadly and came to a very big tree, and in the tiptop of the tree was an enormous  wise old owl.” “Good.”  “Mr Owl,” Roger Skunk said, “all the other little animals run away from me  because I smell so bad.” “So you do,” the  owl said. “Very, very bad.” “What can I  do?” Roger Skunk said, and he cried  very hard. “The wizard, the wizard,” Jo shouted, and sat right up, and a Little  Golden Book spilled from the bed. “Now, Jo. Daddy’s telling the story. Do you want to tell Daddy the story?” “No. You me.”  “Then lie down and be sleepy.”  Her head relapsed onto the pillow and she said, “Out of your head.” “Well. The owl thought and thought. At last he said, “Why don’t you go see the wizard?” “Daddy?”  “What?”  “Are magic spells real?” This was a new phase, just this last month, a reality phase. When he told her spiders  eat bugs, she turned to her mother and asked, “Do they  really?” and when Clare told her God was in the sky and  all around them, she turned to her father and insisted,  with a sly yet eager smile, “Is He really?” “They’re real in stories,” Jack answered curtly. She had made him miss a beat in the narrative. “The owl said,  “Go through the dark woods, under the apple trees, into  the swamp, over the crick —” “What’s a crick?” A little river. “Over the crick, and there will be the wizard’s house.” And that’s the way Roger Skunk went, and pretty soon he came to a little white house, and he  rapped on the door.” Jack rapped on the window sill, and  under the covers Jo’s tall figure clenched in an infantile  thrill. “And then a tiny little old man came out, with a long  white beard and a pointed blue hat, and said, “Eh?  Whatzis? Whatcher want? You smell awful.” The wizard’s  voice was one of Jack’s own favourite effects; he did it by  scrunching up his face and somehow whining through his  eyes, which felt for the interval rheumy. He felt being an  old man suited him. “I know it,” Roger Skunk said, “and all the little animals run away from me. The enormous wise owl said you could  help me.” “Eh? Well, maybe. Come on in. Don’t get too close.” Now, inside, Jo, there were all  these magic things, all jumbled together  in a big dusty heap, because the wizard  did not have any cleaning lady.” “Why?”  “Why? Because he was a wizard, and a very old man.” “Will he die?”  “No. Wizards don’t die. Well, he rummaged around and found an old  stick called a magic wand and asked  Roger Skunk what he wanted to smell  like. Roger thought and thought and  said, “Roses.” “Yes. Good,” Jo said smugly.  Jack fixed her with a trance like gaze and chanted in the wizard’s elderly irritable voice: “Abracadabry, hocus-poo,  Roger Skunk, how do you do,  Roses, boses, pull an ear,  Roger Skunk, you never fear: Bingo!” He paused as a rapt expression widened out from his daughter’s nostrils, forcing her eyebrows up and her lower lip down in a wide noiseless grin, an expression in which  Jack was startled to recognise his wife feigning pleasure  at cocktail parties. “And all of a sudden,” he whispered,  “the whole inside of the wizard’s house was full of the  smell of — roses! ‘Roses!’ Roger Fish cried. And the wizard  said, very cranky, “That’ll be seven pennies.” “Daddy.”  “What?”  “Roger Skunk. You said Roger Fish.” “Yes. Skunk.”  “You said Roger Fish. Wasn’t that silly?”  “Very silly of your stupid old daddy. Where was I? Well, you know about the pennies.” “Say it.”  “O.K. Roger Skunk said, ‘But all I have is four pennies,’ and he began to cry.” Jo made the crying face again, but  this time without a trace of sincerity. This annoyed Jack.  Downstairs some more furniture rumbled. Clare shouldn’t  move heavy things; she was six months pregnant. It would  be their third. “So the wizard said, ‘Oh, very well. Go to the end of the lane and turn around three times and look down the  magic well and there you will find three pennies. Hurry  up.’ So Roger Skunk went to the end of the lane and turned  around three times and there in the magic well were three pennies! So he took them back to the wizard and was very happy and ran out into the woods and all the other little  animals gathered around him because he smelled so good.  And they played tag, baseball, football, basketball, lacrosse,  hockey, soccer, and pick-up-sticks.” “What’s pick-up-sticks?”  “It’s a game you play with sticks.”  “Like the wizard’s magic wand?”  “Kind of. And they played games and laughed all afternoon and then it began to get dark and they all ran  home to their mommies.” \"\"\"\n","text1500 = f\"\"\"It was in early March when the Secretary of the Examinations Board  received the call from Oxford Prison. “It’s a slightly unusual request, Governor, but I don’t see why we shouldn’t  try to help. Just the one fellow, you say?” “That’s it. Chap called Evans. Started night classes in O-level German last September. Says he’s dead keen to get some sort of academic qualification.” “Is he any good?”  “He was the only one in the class, so you can say he’s had individual tuition all the time, really. Would have cost  him a packet if he’d been outside.” “Well, let’s give him a chance, shall we?”  “That’s jolly kind of you. What exactly’s the procedure now?” “Oh, don’t worry about that. I’ll be sending you all the forms and stuff. What’s his name, you say? Evans?” “James Roderick Evans.” It sounded rather grand.  “Just one thing, Governor. He’s not a violent sort of fellow, is he? I don’t want to know his criminal record or  anything like that, but — ” “No. There’s no record of violence. Quite a pleasant sort of chap, they tell me. Bit of a card, really. One of the  stars at the Christmas concert. Imitations, you know the  sort of thing: Mike Yarwood stuff. No, he’s just a congenital  kleptomaniac, that’s all.” The Governor was tempted to  add something else, but he thought better of it. He’d look  after that particular side of things himself. “Presumably,” said the Secretary, “you can arrange a room where — ” “No problem. He’s in a cell on his own. If you’ve no objections, he can sit the exam in there.” “That’s fine.”  “And we could easily get one of the parsons from St. Mary Mags to invigilate, if that’s — ” “Fine, yes. They seem to have a lot of parsons there, don’t they?” The two men chuckled good-naturedly, and  the Secretary had a final thought. “At least there’s one  thing. You shouldn’t have much trouble keeping him  incommunicado, should you?” The Governor chuckled politely once more, reiterated his thanks, and slowly cradled the phone. Evans! “Evans the Break” as the prison officers called him. Thrice he’d escaped from prison, and but for the recent wave of unrest in the maximum-security establishments  up north, he wouldn’t now be gracing the Governor’s  premises in Oxford; and the Governor was going to make  absolutely certain that he wouldn’t be disgracing them. Not that Evans was a real burden: just a persistent, nagging presence. He’d be all right in Oxford, though: the Governor  would see to that — would see to it personally. And besides,  there was just a possibility that Evans was genuinely  interested in O-level German. Just a slight possibility. Just  a very slight possibility. At 8.30 p.m. on Monday 7 June,  Evans’s German teacher shook him by the hand in the  heavily guarded Recreational Block, just across from D  Wing. “Guten Gluck, Herr Evans.” “Pardon?”  “I said, “Good luck”. Good luck for tomorrow.”  “Oh. Thanks, er, I mean, er, Danke Schon.” “You haven’t a cat in hell’s chance of getting through, of course, but — ” “I may surprise everybody,” said Evans.  At 8.30 the following morning, Evans had a visitor. Two visitors, in fact. He tucked his grubby string-vest into  his equally grubby trousers, and stood up from his bunk,  smiling cheerfully. “Mornin”, Mr Jackson. This is indeed  an honour.” Jackson was the senior prison officer on D Wing, and he and Evans had already become warm enemies. At  Jackson’s side stood Officer Stephens, a burly, surly-looking  man, only recently recruited to the profession. Jackson nodded curtly. “And how’s our little Einstein this morning, then?” “Wasn’t ’e a mathematician, Mr Jackson?”  “I think ’e was a Jew, Mr. Jackson.”  Evans’s face was unshaven, and he wore a filthy-looking red-and-white bobble hat upon his head. “Give me a chance, Mr Jackson. I was just goin’ to shave when you bust in.” “Which reminds me.” Jackson turned his eyes on Stephens. “Make sure you take his  razor out of the cell  when he’s finished  scraping that ugly mug  of his. Clear? One of  these days he’ll do us  all a favour and cut his  bloody throat.” For a few seconds Evans looked  thoughtfully at the  man standing ramrod  straight in front of  him, a string of Second World  War medals proudly paraded over  his left breast-pocket. “Mr  Jackson? Was it you who took my nail-scissors away?” Evans had  always worried about his hands. “And your nail-file, too.” “Look!’ For a moment Evans’s eyes smouldered dangerously, but Jackson was ready for him. “Orders of the Governor, Evans.” He leaned forward and leered, his voice dropping to a harsh, contemptuous  whisper. “You want to complain?” Evans shrugged his shoulders lightly. The crisis was over. “You’ve got half an hour to smarten yourself up, Evans — and take that bloody hat off!” “Me ’at? Huh!” Evans put his right hand lovingly on top of the filthy woollen, and smiled sadly. “D’you know,  Mr Jackson, it’s the only thing that’s ever brought me any  sort o’ luck in life. Kind o’ lucky charm, if you know what I  mean. And today I thought — well, with me exam and all  that...” Buried somewhere in Jackson, was a tiny core of compassion; and Evans knew it. “Just this once, then, Shirley Temple.” (If there was one thing that Jackson genuinely loathed about Evans it was his long, wavy hair.) “And get shaving!” At 8.45 the same morning the Reverend Stuart McLeery left his bachelor flat in Broad Street and stepped out briskly  towards Carfax. The weatherman reported temperatures  considerably below the normal for early June, and a long  black overcoat and a shallow-crowned clerical hat provided  welcome protection from the steady drizzle which had set  in half an hour earlier and which now spattered the thick  lenses of his spectacles. In his right hand he was carrying  a small brown suitcase, which contained all that he would  need for his morning duties, including a sealed question  paper envelope, a yellow invigilation form, a special  “authentication” card from the Examinations Board, a paper  knife, a Bible (he was to speak to the Women’s Guild that  afternoon on the Book of Ruth), and a current copy of The Church Times. The two-hour examination was scheduled to start at 9.15 a.m. Evans was lathering his face vigorously when Stephens brought in two small square tables, and set them opposite  each other in the narrow space between the bunk on the  one side and on the other a distempered stone wall. Next,  Stephens brought in two hard chairs, the slightly less  battered of which he placed in front of the table which  stood nearer the cell door. Jackson put in a brief final appearance. “Behave yourself, laddy!” Evans turned and nodded.  “And these” — (Jackson pointed to the pin-ups) — “off!”  Evans turned and nodded again. “I was goin’ to take “em down anyway. A minister, isn’t ’e? The chap comin’ to  sit in, I mean.” “And how did you know that?” asked Jackson quietly.  “Well, I ’ad to sign some forms, didn’t I? And I couldn’t ’elp — ” Evans drew the razor carefully down his left cheek, and left a neat swath in the white lather. “Can I ask you something, Mr. Jackson? Why did they ’ave to bug me in this cell?” He nodded his head vaguely to a point above the  door. “Not a very neat job,” conceded Jackson.  “They’re not — they don’t honestly think I’m goin’ to try to — ” “They’re taking no chances, Evans. Nobody in his senses would take any chance with you.” “Who’s goin’ to listen in?”  “I’ll tell you who’s going to listen in, laddy. It’s the Governor himself, see? He don’t trust you a bloody inch —  and nor do I. I’ll be watching you like a hawk, Evans, so  keep your nose clean. Clear?” He walked towards the door. Evans nodded. He’d already thought of that, and Number Two Handkerchief was lying ready on the bunk —  a neatly folded square of off-white linen. “Just one more thing, Einstein.”  “Ya? Wha’s ‘at?”  “Good luck, old son.”  In the little lodge just inside the prison’s main gates, the Reverend S. McLeery signed his name neatly in the  visitors’ book, and thence walked side by side with a silent  prison officer across the exercise yard to D Wing, where he  was greeted by Jackson. The Wing’s heavy outer door was  unlocked, and locked behind them, the heavy inner door  the same, and McLeery was handed into Stephens’s keeping. “Get the razor?” murmured Jackson.  Stephens nodded.  “Well, keep your eyes skinned. Clear?”  Stephens nodded again; and McLeery, his feet clanging up the iron stairs, followed his new guide, and finally stood  before a cell door, where Stephens opened the peep-hole  and looked through. “That’s him, sir.”  Evans, facing the door, sat quietly at the farther of the two tables, his whole attention riveted to a textbook of  elementary German grammar. Stephens took the key from  its ring, and the cell lock sprang back with a thudded,  metallic twang.\"\"\"\n","text650 = f\"\"\"Six hundred and fifty million years ago, a giant amalgamated southern supercontinent — Gondwana — did  indeed exist, centred roughly around the present-day 19Journey to the end of the Earth Antarctica. Things were quite different then: humans hadn’t arrived on the global scene, and the climate was  much warmer, hosting a huge variety of flora and fauna.  For 500 million years Gondwana thrived, but around the  time when the dinosaurs were wiped out and the age of  the mammals got under way, the landmass was forced to  separate into countries, shaping the globe much as we  know it today. To visit Antarctica now is to be a part of that history; to get a grasp of  where we’ve come from and where we  could possibly be heading. It’s to  understand the significance of  Cordilleran folds and pre-Cambrian  granite shields; ozone and carbon;  evolution and extinction. When you think  about all that can happen in a million  years, it can get pretty mind-boggling.  Imagine: India pushing northwards,  jamming against Asia to buckle its crust and form the Himalayas; South America drifting off to join  North America, opening up the Drake Passage to create a  cold circumpolar current, keeping Antarctica frigid,  desolate, and at the bottom of the world. For a sun-worshipping South Indian like myself, two weeks in a place where 90 per cent of the Earth’s total ice  volumes are stored is a chilling prospect (not just for  circulatory and metabolic functions, but also for the  imagination). It’s like walking into a giant ping-pong ball devoid of any human markers — no trees, billboards, buildings. You lose all earthly sense of perspective and  time here. The visual scale ranges from the microscopic to  the mighty: midges and mites to blue whales and icebergs  as big as countries (the largest recorded was the size of  Belgium). Days go on and on and on in surreal 24-hour  austral summer light, and a ubiquitous silence, interrupted  only by the occasional avalanche or calving ice sheet,  consecrates the place. It’s an immersion that will force you  to place yourself in the context of the earth’s geological  history. And for humans, the prognosis isn’t good. 20Vistas devoid of any human markers — no trees, billboards, buildings. You lose all earthly sense of perspective and  time here.

In that short amount of time, we’ve managed to create  quite a ruckus, etching our dominance over Nature with  our villages, towns, cities, megacities. The rapid increase of human populations has left us battling  with other species for limited resources,  and the unmitigated burning of fossil  fuels has now created a blanket of  carbon dioxide around the world, which  is slowly but surely increasing the  average global temperature. Climate change is one of the most hotly contested environmental debates  of our time. Will the West Antarctic ice  sheet melt entirely? Will the Gulf Stream ocean current be disrupted? Will it be the end of the world  as we know it? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way, Antarctica  is a crucial element in this debate — not just because it’s  the only place in the world, which has never sustained a  human population and therefore remains relatively  ‘pristine’ in this respect; but more importantly, because it  holds in its ice-cores half-million-year-old carbon records  trapped in its layers of ice. If we want to study and examine  the Earth’s past, present and future, Antarctica is the place to go.\"\"\"\n","text651 = f\"\"\"Nikola Tesla is regarded as one of history's most influential inventors, with discoveries in the area of electricity that were far ahead of their time and continue to have an impact on technology today. Tesla died penniless and without the acclaim that he would eventually receive over a century later, despite his achievements.  Tesla's career as an inventor began early; at the age of 26, he is said to have sketched up the concepts for a rotating magnetic field while working at the Central Telegraph Office in Budapest, an essential innovation that is currently employed in many electromechanical devices. This huge breakthrough paved the way for many of his other innovations, including the alternating current motor, and eventually brought him to New York City in 1884, where he was drawn by Thomas Edison and his groundbreaking engineering firm, Edison Machine Works.  The “genius who illuminated the world” is now memorialised with an electrical unit known as the Tesla, as well as streets, statues, and a prominent engineer's award in his honour, but he wasn't always so successful in life. But Tesla was a scientist, who had deep theories always in mind. Let’s discuss Nikola Tesla Information here completely.  Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in the town of Smiljan, which is now part of Croatia but was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a priest, while his mother, despite her lack of formal education, worked with machinery and was known for her incredible memory. Keep reading the article for the entire Nikola Tesla biography. Tesla's family relocated to nearby Gospi in 1862, where Tesla's father served as a parish priest. Nikola finished primary school and then moved on to middle school. Tesla travelled to Karlovac in 1870 to attend the Higher Real Gymnasium, where classes were taught in German, as was the case throughout the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier. Tesla later wrote that his physics professor sparked his interest in electricity demonstrations. These displays of this \"mystery phenomenon\" made Tesla want to \"know more about this wonderful power,\" he said. Tesla's ability to complete integral calculus in his mind led his teachers to suspect he was cheating. He graduated in 1873 after completing a four-year term in three years.  Tesla returned to Smiljan in 1873. He developed cholera shortly after arriving, was bedridden for nine months, and came close to death several times. Tesla's father pledged to send him to the top engineering school if he recovered from his illness in a time of despair. Tesla escaped conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan in 1874 by fleeing to Tomingaj, southeast of Lika. He went there dressed as a hunter and explored the mountains. Tesla claimed that his contact with nature made him physically and intellectually stronger. While at Tomingaj, he studied a lot of books and later claimed that Mark Twain's works had miraculously helped him recover from his former illness.  Tesla received a Military Frontier scholarship to the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875. Tesla never missed a lecture during his first year, obtained the highest marks possible, passed nine tests, founded a Serb cultural society, and even received a letter of congratulations from the dean of the technical college to his father, stating, \"Your son is a star of the first rank.\" Professor Jakob Pöschl's thorough lectures on electricity enthralled Tesla while he was in Graz. Tesla discovered, designed, and developed ideas for a number of significant innovations, the majority of which were officially patented by other inventors, including dynamos (electrical generators comparable to batteries) and the induction motor, over the course of his career. He was also a pioneer in the development of radar, X-ray, remote control, and the rotating magnetic field, which is the foundation of most AC machinery. Tesla is most recognised for his contributions to AC power and the Tesla coil, which he invented. \"\"\"\n","text600 = f\"\"\"Albert Einstein was a Theoretical Physicist of German origin. He is the one who developed a pillar of modern Physics, the Theory of Relativity. Be it his mass-energy equivalence formula or his law of photoelectric effect, the theories he postulated changed the history of science forever. His works are still studied in standard institutions of learning throughout the world.lbert Einstein was born on 14th March 1879 in Ulm in the Kingdom of Wurttemberg in the German empire. His father's name was Herman Einstein and his mother's name was Pauline Koch. His father worked as a salesman and as an engineer. In 1880, his father along with his family moved to Munich. His father and his uncle founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie. It is a company that manufactures electrical equipment based on direct current.  After birth, Albert Einstein's head was much larger than his body and he was born as a deformed abnormal child. Usually, children start speaking at the age of 2, but Albert Einstein started speaking after 4 years of age. When Einstein was 5 years old, his father gifted him with a magnetic compass on his birthday. The needle of the compass used to be in the North Direction, and seeing this, he became very fascinated and developed an interest to explore science well. Albert Einstein was born on 14th March 1879, in Ulm, where his family ran a small shop. He had two siblings, an elder sister named Maja and a younger brother named Hans Albert. The Einsteins were non-observant Jews and moved to Munich when Albert was one year old. His parents wanted him to become a businessman, but he showed scientific inclinations from his childhood days. From 1890, the family resided in Milan where Einstein underwent Technical High School education. Since his father had relocated to Italy for work purposes, Albert Einstein decided not to move with his family to Berlin after matriculating from the Zurich Polytechnic in 1896.  He had problems with authority and left his academic institutions without a degree on several occasions. He started working as a patent clerk at the Swiss Patent Office in 1902, where he spent most of his time on theoretical physics. In 1905, he published four papers that revolutionized Physics. They were on (I) Brownian motion, (ii) photoelectric effect, (iii) special relativity and (iv) equivalence of mass and energy, which is famously known as the E=mc2 equation. He worked on unified field Theory for more than ten years but was unable to complete it. At the age of 5, he joined the Catholic Elementary School in Munich. After that, he enrolled in Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received his primary and secondary school education. When Albert Einstein was 15 years old, his father wanted him to do electrical engineering but Einstein used to fight with the authority of his school, about their way of teaching. He believed that due to so many strict rules and regulations in the school, the creative mind of children was lost and they only knew the strict rote learning. Einstein was thrown out of school too many times due to this behavior of his. He used to fight with his teachers, he also raised questions about their way of teaching.  At the age of 12, Einstein started learning Calculus on his own, and when he became 14 years old, he mastered Integral and Differential Calculus. Einstein got married in 1903 to Marci. In 1904 his son named Hans Albert Einstein was born, and in 1910 his second son Eduard was born.\"\"\"\n","text860 = f\"\"\"Elon Musk life story begins in South Africa, where he was born. Later, he went on to become an American entrepreneur who co-founded PayPal and established SpaceX, a launch vehicle and spacecraft manufacturer. He was also one of the original major investors in and the CEO of Tesla, an electric car company.  Elon Reeve Musk is the eldest of his parents' three children, and a citizen of three countries: South Africa, Canada, and the United States. He was born in 1971 to Maye Musk, a model and nutritionist, and Errol Musk, an electromechanical engineer whom Elon has described as \"a dreadful human being.\" Read the entire article to learn about Elon Musk History which is inspiring for generations to come. Musk was born in Canada to a Canadian mother and a South African father. Musk grew up with his head stuck in books and computers. He was bullied by his classmates and often beaten up by class bullies as a little, timid youngster until he grew strong enough to defend himself during a growth spurt in his teens. He developed a video game at the age of 12 and sold it to a computer magazine. Musk left South Africa in 1988 after getting a Canadian passport because he refused to support apartheid through compulsory military duty and wanted to pursue the higher economic prospects offered in the United States.    Musk travelled to Canada at the age of 17 to attend Queen's University and evade military service in South Africa. Musk got his Canadian citizenship the same year, partly because he thought it would be easier to get American citizenship that way. Musk moved to the United States in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He earned an undergraduate degree in economics before continuing on to earn a second bachelor's degree in physics. Musk went to Stanford University in California to earn a Ph.D. in energy physics after leaving Penn. But that Ph.D couldn’t make it to Elon Musk Degrees since he walked out of Stanford after only two days to start his first firm. In the summer of 1995, Musk relocated to Silicon Valley. He enrolled at Stanford University's PhD programme in applied physics, but dropped out after only two days. Kimball Musk, Elon's 15-month younger brother, had recently graduated from Queen's University with a business degree and had travelled to California to join him. As the early Internet grew in popularity, the brothers decided to develop a company called Zip2, an internet business directory with maps. That’s how Elon Musk started entering into the business world.  Zip2 eventually recruited angel investors and grew into a profitable firm thanks to the brothers' efforts. Zip2 was sold to Compaq for ＄307 million in 1999 by the brothers. Elon subsequently went on to create his own online financial services company, X.com. Confinity, a company formed by Peter Thiel and two others mere months after X.com and with headquarters in the same building, was its main competitor. In March 2000, the two firms joined and adopted the name of their major product, PayPal, an online money transfer service for individuals. In October 2002, Ebay, the online auction site, purchased PayPal for ＄1.5 billion in Ebay stock. Elon Musk, who had been the largest shareholder in PayPal with 11.7% of the company's equity shares, found himself with ＄165 million in Ebay stock at the age of 31.  Since leaving PayPal, he has founded, co-founded, and/or led companies focused on addressing three distinct existential risks to humanity's long-term survival: climate risk, single-planet dependency risk, and human species obsolescence risk. Two of these companies, SpaceX and Tesla Motors, he risked his entire early fortune to build. Musk joined engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to help operate Tesla Motors in 2004, where he played a key role in the development of the world's first electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. Musk took over as CEO and product architect after Eberhard was fired from the company in 2007 due to a series of conflicts. Tesla has grown to be one of the most popular and desirable vehicle brands in the world under his leadership.  Elon Musk's SpaceX has signed many high-profile contracts with NASA and the US Air Force to manufacture rockets and execute military missions. Musk has been vocal about his desire to work with NASA on a collaborative mission to deploy an astronaut to Mars by 2025. Elon Musk has always been a proponent of various space-age technologies, but it hasn't always been a smooth journey for him. He went on to become a small business owner and eventually the CEO of two creative firms after being bullied in school. But he made the decision to ascend from there and never settle for anything less.  Tesla, in addition to creating electric automobiles, has a strong presence in the solar energy sector, courtesy to its purchase of SolarCity. This clean-energy services company, which was founded in 2006, now develops two rechargeable solar batteries that are primarily used for stationary energy storage. The Powerwall is designed for residential backup power and off-grid use, whereas the Powerpack is designed for business or electric utility grid use.\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","# Chemistry\n","text211 = f\"\"\" J.J.Thomson carried out experiments by taking gases at low pressure of 0.01mm Hg in a discharge tube. A discharge tube is a long glass tube having two metal plates connected to the oppositely charged poles of a battery. These metal plates are called cathode and anode. Application of high voltage results in ionisation of gas by ejection of negatively charged particles which were named as electrons. These particles originate from cathode rays. The presence of positively charged particles in an atom had been predicted by Goldstein based on the electrical neutrality of an atom. The discovery of protons by Goldstein was based on the electrical neutrality of an atom. The discovery of protons by Goldstein was done on the basis of the cathode ray experiment. The resultant positively charged ions after the ejection of electrons were found to emanate from the anode. These are called anode rays or canal rays. Anode rays or canal rays are a stream of positively charged particles. When hydrogen gas is taken in a discharge tube, the anode rays were found to be nothing but protons. The discovery of electrons and protons as subatomic particles inside the atom leads to the conception of atomic models which depict the arrangement of the fundamental particles in an atom. \"\"\"\n","text269 = f\"\"\"Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table and has the atomic number one. Those elements which have the same atomic number but a different mass number are called isotopes. There are three isotopes of hydrogen namely, protium 11H, deuterium 21H or D and lastly tritium 31H or T. The isotopes are different because of the different number of neutrons present in them. In protium, there is no presence of neutrons, whereas in deuterium we have one neutron and in tritium, we have two neutrons. The most prominent form of hydrogen is protium, 0.0156% of hydrogen is present on the earth’s surface as deuterium. In tritium, the concentration is one atom per 1018 atoms of protium. Out of these three isotopes of hydrogen, Out of these three isotopes of hydrogen, only tritium is radioactive in nature which emits low-energy beta particles. As the electronic configuration of isotopes is the same, they all have similar chemical properties. But they have a difference in their rates of reaction, this happens because of the different bond disassociation enthalpies. They have different physical properties because of the large variations in mass. The occurrence of hydrogen on earth is difficult due to its light nature. In combined it forms 15.4% of hydrogen that occurs in the earth’s crust and oceans. Hydrogen also occurs in plant and animal tissues, hydrocarbons, proteins, hydrides, and many other compounds. In the universe, hydrogen is the most abundant element (70% of the total mass) and it is also the principal element of the solar atmosphere. Even the huge planets such as Jupiter and Saturn mainly consist of hydrogen.\"\"\"\n","text350 = f\"\"\"There are five basic laws of chemical combination that govern the chemical combinations of elements. 1. Law of Conservation of Mass  In simple terms, this law states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed. In other words, the total mass, that is, the sum of the mass of reacting mixture and the products formed remains constant. Antoine Lavoisier gave this law in the year 1789 based on the data he obtained after carefully studying numerous combustion reactions. 2. Law of Definite Proportions  Joseph Proust, a French chemist stated that the proportion of elements by weight in a given compound will always remain exactly the same. In simple terms, we can say that irrespective of its source, origin or its quantity, the per cent composition of elements by weight in a given compound will always remain the same. 3. Law of Multiple Proportions  This law states that if two elements combine to form more than one compound, the masses of these elements in the reaction are in the ratio of small whole numbers. This law was given by Dalton in the year 1803. 4.  Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes  In 1808, Gay Lussac gave this law based on his observations. This law states that when gases are produced or combine in a chemical reaction, they do so in a simple ratio by volume given that all the gases are at the same temperature and pressure. This law can be considered as another form of the law of definite proportions. The only difference between these two laws of chemical combination is that Gay Lussac’s Law is stated with respect to volume while the law of definite proportions is stated with respect to mass. 5. Avogadro’s Law  Avogadro proposed this law in the year 1811. It stated that under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, an equal volume of all the gases contains an equal number of molecules. This implies that 2 litres of hydrogen will have the same number of molecules as 2 litres of oxygen given that both the gases are at the same temperature and pressure.\"\"\"\n","text1083 = f\"\"\"The Pauli Exclusion Principle is one of the important principles, along with the Aufbau Principle and Hund’s Rule in Chemistry. Learning about it is crucial for students, especially when they are studying about electrons. The Pauli exclusion principle basically helps us to understand the electron arrangements in atoms and molecules, and it also gives an explanation for the classification of elements in the periodic table. In this section, we will study the Pauli exclusion principle in detail and learn about all the underlying concepts. What Is the Pauli Exclusion Principle?  The Pauli exclusion principle states that in a single atom, no two electrons will have an identical set or the same quantum numbers (n, l, ml, and ms). To put it in simple terms, every electron should have or be in its own unique state (singlet state). There are two salient rules that the Pauli exclusion principle follows:      Only two electrons can occupy the same orbital.     The two electrons that are present in the same orbital must have opposite spins, or they should be antiparallel.  However, the Pauli exclusion principle does not only apply to electrons, it applies to other particles of half-integer spin, such as fermions. It is not relevant for particles with an integer spin, such as bosons which have symmetric wave functions. Moreover, bosons can share or have the same quantum states, unlike fermions. As far as the nomenclature goes, fermions are named after the Fermi–Dirac statistical distribution that they follow. Bosons, on the other hand, get their name from the Bose-Einstein distribution function. Formulation of the Principle  An Austrian physicist named Wolfgang Pauli formulated the principle in the year 1925. With this principle, he basically described the behaviour of the electrons. Later in the year 1940, he expanded on the principle to cover all fermions under his spin-statistics theorem. Besides, fermions that are described by the principle include elementary particles such as quarks, electrons, neutrinos, and baryons.  Wolfgang Pauli was awarded the Nobel Prize in the year 1945 for the discovery of the Pauli exclusion principle and his overall contribution to the field of quantum mechanics. He was nominated by Albert Einstein for the award. Pauli Exclusion Principle in Chemistry  In Chemistry, the law is mainly used to explain or determine the electron shell structure of atoms and predict which atoms are likely to donate electrons. How does the principle work, or where does it apply? Well, if we look at the atoms, whenever it gains a new electron or electrons, it usually moves to the lowest energy state or shifts to the outermost shell. If the state has one electron, then it can either spin up or spin down. Now, if we consider the Pauli exclusion principle, if there are two electrons in a state, then each of the electrons will have a spinup or spin downstate but not the same. Pauli Exclusion Principle Example  We can take a neutral helium atom as a common Pauli exclusion principle example. The atom has 2 bound electrons, and they occupy the outermost shell with opposite spins. Here, we will find that the two electrons are in the 1s subshell where n = 1, l = 0, and ml = 0.  Their spin moments will also be different. One will be ms = -1/2, and the other will be +1/2. If we draw a diagram, then the subshell of the helium atom will be represented with 1 “up” electron and 1 “down” electron. In essence, 1s subshell consists of two electrons, which have opposite spins.  Similarly, if we take hydrogen, it will have 1s subshell with 1 “up” electron (1s1). Lithium will have the helium core (1s2) and then one more “up” electron ( 2s1). What we are trying to depict here is that the electron configuration of the orbitals is written in the following manner. Pauli Exclusion Principle  From the above example, we can further deduce that successive larger elements will have shells of successively higher energy. The number of electrons in the outermost shell is also directly related to the different chemical properties that elements possess. Elements with the same number of electrons in the outermost shell will have similar properties. Nuclear Stability and Pauli Exclusion Principle  The nuclei in an atom consist of neutrons and protons, which are held together by the nuclear force. However, protons tend to repel each other via electromagnetic force as a result of their positive charge. Basically, these two forces are working against (competing) each other, thereby leading to the stability of nuclei. Meanwhile, you will find only certain sets or combinations of protons and neutrons that form stable nuclei. The nucleus is mostly stabilised by the neutrons as they attract each other and protons. This further helps counterbalance the electrical repulsion between protons. When this happens, the number of protons goes up. In essence, an increasing ratio of neutrons to protons is needed to form a stable nucleus.  In case there are a larger number of (neutrons also obey the Pauli exclusion principle) or too few neutrons for a given number of protons, the nucleus of the atom is not stable. This will lead to radioactive decay. In addition, Pauli exclusion principle also has an effect on the critical energy of fissile and fissionable nuclei. For example, if we look at actinides that have an odd neutron number, they are usually fissile or, in other words, fissionable with slow neutrons. On the other hand, actinides that have even neutron numbers are usually not fissile, or we can say that they are fissionable with fast neutrons. Similarly, due to the Pauli exclusion principle, heavy nuclei with an even number of protons and neutrons are very stable due to the presence of ‘paired spin’. Alternatively, nuclei with an odd number are unstable. Importance and Applications of Pauli Exclusion Principle      The Pauli exclusion principle helps to explain a wide variety of physical phenomena, such as the electron shell structure of atoms and the way atoms share electrons.     It helps in describing the various chemical elements and how they participate in forming chemical bonds.     The periodic table can also be defined with the help of this principle.     Solid-state properties: Many electrical,  optical, magnetic, mechanical and chemical properties of solids are the direct consequence of Pauli exclusion.     The principle helps in describing the stability of large systems with many electrons and many nucleons.     Apart from Chemistry, the principle is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics which is mainly studied in Physics.     It is also used in astrophysics. \"\"\"\n","text1100 = f\"\"\"The melting point is usually defined as the point at which materials changes from a solid to a liquid.  The temperature at which solid changes its state to liquid at atmospheric pressure is called the melting point of that liquid. This is the point at which both liquid and solid phase exists at equilibrium. The melting point of the substance also varies with pressure and is specified at standard pressure. The term ‘freezing point’ is used to denote the temperature at which a liquid is converted into a solid and can, therefore, be viewed as the opposite of the term ‘melting point’. However, substances can be cooled below their freezing points without the formation of a solid. Such liquids are known as supercooled liquids. What is Boiling Point?      The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure of the liquid’s environment. At this temperature, the liquid is converted into a vapour.  The boiling point of the liquid depends upon the pressure of the surrounding. When the liquid is at high pressure, it has a higher boiling point than the boiling point at normal atmospheric pressure. The boiling point of different liquids is different for a given pressure. In 1982, IUPAC defined the standard boiling point of a liquid as the temperature at which the liquid boils under a pressure of 1 bar. Boiling Point Definition  The temperature at which liquid vapour pressure equals atmospheric pressure is referred to as boiling point. The boiling point is defined as the temperature at which a liquid’s saturated vapour pressure equals the atmospheric pressure surrounding it.  The boiling point for any material is the temperature point at which the material transforms into the gas phase in the liquid phase. This happens at 100 degrees centigrade for water. The Celsius scale was in fact created on the basis of the ice/water melting point and the liquid water/vapor boiling point. Each substance carries its own boiling point.  The boiling point of a substance is dependent on the pressure of its surroundings. In mountainous terrains (where the altitude is high), the pressure of the atmosphere is relatively lower than the atmospheric pressure at sea level. This is the reason why food cooks at a slower pace in mountainous areas (the lower atmospheric pressure causes water to boil at temperatures below 100oC).  When all the particles in the liquid phase have been transformed into the gas phase, the temperature begins to rise again, as long as heat is still being applied to the surrounding system. As the temperature starts to increase, so does the particle’s kinetic energy. Boiling Point of Water  Water can boil, raise temperature or decrease air pressure, in two ways. At sea level, it is the pressure of air that causes water to boil at 100oC. Water can boil at a much lower temperature in vacuum, where there’s no air. That is, if not for the skin that keeps the blood pressurized, body temperature would be sufficient to cause the blood to boil with water. At low air pressure the water boils significantly below 100oC at temperatures.  The boiling point of water is the temperature at which the liquid water vapor pressure is equal to the pressure surrounding the body, and the body transforms into a vapour. The boiling point is the temperature for a particular liquid to boil at. For example, the boiling point for water, at a pressure of 1 atm, is 100 degrees Celsius. A liquid’s boiling point depends upon the liquid ‘s temperature, atmospheric pressure, and vapor pressure.  Melting Point Determination Principle      Melting point may be defined in various ways, each corresponding to a different residual amount of solid fat.     The capillary tube melting point, also known as the complete melting point or clear point, is the temperature at which fat heated at a given rate becomes completely clear and liquid in a one end closed capillary.     The slip melting point is performed similarly to the capillary tube method and measures the temperature at which a column of fat maves in an open capillary when heated.     The dropping melting point or dropping point is the temperature at which the sample flows through a 0.11-in hole in a sample up placed in a specialized furnace.     The Wiley melting point measures the temperature at which a 1/8 x 3/8 in disc of fat suspended in an alcohol water mixture of similar density changes into a sphere.  Melting Point Determination  The melting point is determined in a capillary tube. The temperature at which the substance is completely melted as indicated by the disappearance of the solid, will be in the range of + or – 4oC from the stated value, unless otherwise indicated. Details of the Procedure  The following technique is adequate for the determination of melting point.  Grind about 50mg of the substance to be tested in a small motor. Place the ground substance in a vacuum desiccator over silica gel or phosphorus pentoxide at room temperature and dry for about 24 hours. Place the substance in a dry capillary tube of 1mm internal diameter forming a column about 3mm high. Heat the melting point apparatus to a temperature of 5-10oC below the expected temperature of melting and adjust the heating so that the temperature in the chamber rises about 1oC per minute. Introduce the capillary with the substance into the heated chamber and note the temperature when the sintered substance becomes completely transparent, this is considered to be the melting point. The melting point denotes the temperature at which the substance has just completely melted; this is indicated by the disappearance of the solid phase and complete transparency of the melt. Mixed Melting Points  In the majority of cases, the presence of a foreign substance will lower the melting point of a pure organic compound. This fact is utilised in the so-called mixed melting point test for the identification of organic compounds.  Consider an organic compound X having a melting point of 140oC is suspected to be o-chlorobenzoic acid. Its identity may be established by performing a melting point determination of a mixture containing approximately equal weights of X and of an authentic specimen of o-chlorobenzoic acid (A). If the melting point of the mixture is 140oC then X is o-chlorobenzoic acid, but if the melting point is depressed by several degrees A and X cannot be identical. It is recommended that at least three minutes containing say 20 percent X +80 percent A:50 percent X+50 percent A; and 80 percent X+20 percent A be prepared and the melting point be determined.\"\"\"\n","text770 = f\"\"\"What is Thermodynamics?  The branch which deals with the movement of energy from one form to the other and the relation between heat and temperature with energy and work done is called as thermodynamics. In other terms we can define thermodynamics as the science stream that deals with the study of the combined effects of heat and work on the changes of state of matter confined by the laws of thermodynamics.  Chemical reactions which releases heat energy associated with it are converted into different usable forms based on the laws of thermodynamics. The fact that energy can only be transformed from one form to the other forms and its use in different industries is on the basis of energy transformation. We are aware that chemical reactions have energy associated with it. The laws of thermodynamics deal with energy changes during a reaction and are not concerned with the rate at which the reaction is proceeding. Define Chemical Thermodynamics  Chemical thermodynamics is the study of relation between work, heat and chemical reactions or with the physical changes of the state which are confined to the laws of thermodynamics.  Some general terms like heat, energy, and work were done are often used in thermodynamics. Let us learn a bit about basic thermodynamics and understand these terms. Internal Energy  It referred to the energy content within the system. The energy represents the overall energy of the system and may include many forms of energy such as potential energy, kinetic energy etc. In a chemical reaction, we know about the energy transformations and basic thermodynamics provides us with the information regarding energy change associated with the particles of the system.  Factors Affecting the Internal Energy  The internal energy of a system may change when:      Heat passes into or out of the system,     Work is done on or by the system or matter enters or leaves the system.  Also Check ⇒ Internal energy Work  Work done by a system is defined as the quantity of energy exchanged between a system and its surroundings. Work is completely governed by external factors such as an external force, pressure or volume or change in temperature etc. Heat  Heat in thermodynamics is defined as the kinetic energy of the molecules of the substance. Heat and the thermodynamics together form the basics which helped process designers and engineers to optimize their processes and harness the energy associated with chemical reactions economically. Heat energy flows from higher temperature to lower temperature. Thermodynamic System and the Surrounding  Thermodynamics defines a system as the part of the universe under study that is the part where observations are made. The surrounding and universe interact with each other and depending on the type of the system, exchange of matter and energies occur. The system’s classification entirely depends on the movement of energy and matter in or out of the system. There are two types of system:      Open System:  Those systems where the exchange of energy, as well as matter takes place, are treated as an open system. For example, water is boiled on a stove without it being covered, the container behaves as an open system because it receives heat energy from an external source and the matter being released are water vapours.      Closed System:  A closed system is referred to the system where only energy can be exchanged with the surrounding and not the matter. It can also be said that a closed system has a constant amount of matter and only the energy of the system can be changed. For instance, when we keep a shield bottle of water in the fridge, the loss of energy to the surrounding will result in the temperature of the water inside it going down even though the quantity of water in the bottle remains the same.      Isolated System:  In case of isolated systems, neither energy nor matter can be exchanged between the system and the surrounding. An example of an isolated system is a Thermos flask.  Let us see the major aspects on which environment can affect the thermodynamics of a system. There are four laws which govern the thermodynamic systems’ phenomena, they are: Laws of Thermodynamics      First law of thermodynamics: When energy moves into or out of a system, the system’s internal energy changes in accordance with the law of conservation of mass.     Second law of thermodynamics: The state of the entropy of the entire universe, as an isolated system, will always increase over time.     Third law of thermodynamics: Entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is zero.  The laws of thermodynamics were the most important lesson for people understanding the mechanism behind phase change of matter.\"\"\"\n","text630 = f\"\"\"Organic chemistry is the branch of Chemistry that involves the scientific study of organic compounds (compounds that contain covalently bonded carbon atoms). This branch of chemistry primarily deals with the structure and chemical composition of organic compounds, the physical and chemical properties of organic compounds, and the chemical reactions undergone by these compounds. Advancements in the field of organic chemistry have made numerous contributions to human society, such as the synthesis of several drugs, polymers, and other natural products. Synthetic organic chemistry is an important application of organic chemistry that deals with the design and construction of organic compounds for practical purposes.  The term  ‘organic’ was coined because the field of organic chemistry was initially finite to compounds that were produced by living organisms. This was attributed to some ‘vital force’ that was present in organic substances as they had something that inanimate substances lacked. The above theory was debunked when Urey Miller synthesised urea from inorganic substances, but the classification is still in use.  Organic chemistry is a vast science due to one key property exhibited by the element carbon, which is called carbon catenation. Carbon has the exceptional ability to form very stable bonds with other carbon atoms, giving it the ability to form stable molecules with relatively complex structures. Catenation is the ability of an element to form bonds with an atom of the same kind. Hence, the vastness of organic chemistry can be attributed to this property of carbon. The importance of organic chemistry in the present age is as immense as it has been since its inception. It plays an important role in our everyday life because food, medicines, paper, clothes, soap, perfumes, etc., are indispensable to us for proper living. The study of organic chemistry is important for chemists and pharmacists in synthesising medicines for the alleviation of human suffering.  The reactions in organic chemistry occur between organic compounds. Let us now study the different terminologies, classifications, field effects, types of reagents, the stability of intermediates, and properties in detail.  Cleavage of Bonds  The reactions in organic chemistry occur through the breaking and making of bonds. Bonds can cleave in either of two ways:      Homolytic cleavage     Heterolytic cleavage  What Is Homolytic Cleavage?  If the covalent bonds between two elements break in such a way that each of the elements gets its own electrons, it is called homolytic cleavage. That is, each element gets an electron. Homolytic cleavage results in the formation of free radicals. What Is Heterolytic Cleavage?  If the covalent bonds between two elements break heterolytically, i.e., unequally, it results in the formation of charged species. This type of bond breaking, where the electrons are unevenly distributed, is called heterolytic cleavage. Heterolytic Cleavage Reaction Intermediates in Organic Chemistry  Intermediates can be understood as the first product of a consecutive reaction. For example, in a chemical reaction, if A→B and B→C, then B can be said to be the intermediate for reaction A→C. The reactions in organic chemistry occur via the formation of these intermediates. What Are Carbenes?  Carbenes (H2C) are neutral and reactive species that have six electrons in the outer shell of carbon, making them electron deficient. Since carbenes are species having two odd electrons, we can classify carbenes based on their spin states. Singlet Carbene  The electrons are present in different orbitals with opposite spins. The electrons are paired in sp2 hybridized orbitals and behave as paired electrons.  Spin state= (2S + 1), S for singlet carbene is zero, as the electrons are antiparallel.  Therefore, spin state = (2 × 0 + 1) = 1 Triplet Carbene  Both electrons are present in different orbitals, and they possess the same spin.  Spin state = (2S + 1), S for triplet carbene is 1, as both electrons have the same spin.  Therefore, spin state= (2 × 1 + 1) = 3 \"\"\"\n","text413 = f\"\"\"Waste management  Lots of solid waste is generated in the neighbourhood. Apart from household wastes, we also have medical, agricultural, mining and industrial wastes. The improper disposal of these wastes results in environmental pollution. Hence, care must be taken while disposing of these wastes to reduce the pollution levels in our surroundings.   Collection and disposal of wastes  The domestic waste that is generated is collected into bins and transferred to the municipal workers who take it to the disposable site. At the site, the waste is sorted out and separated as biodegradable and non-biodegradable. The plastic wastes (non-biodegradable wastes) such as bottles, plastic bags etc., are sent for recycling. Whereas the biodegradable wastes are deposited on the land and converted into compost.  If the waste is not collected for disposal then it finds its way into the sewers. Some wastes are eaten by the cattle. Non-biodegradable wastes like metal scrap and plastic bags choke the sewers and cause incontinence. Cattles swallow these polythene bags and choke their throat. This makes it difficult for them to breathe and may result in their death.  We all should follow the practice of collecting the waste and then disposing it properly. If the waste management technique is not followed then it may result in epidemics due to groundwater contamination and lead to Water Pollution. It is especially hazardous to the people who directly come in contact with the waste for example rag pickers and the workers involved in waste disposal. These people are largely affected because they do not use any protective devices like gloves and masks while handling the waste.  Improper disposal also allows poisonous gases to escape into the atmosphere and cause Air Pollution. Not only this, but the vehicles and industries pump hazardous gases that directly or indirectly affect us and contribute to Air Pollution.  Being responsible citizens we should be a part of the proper waste disposal management and cooperate with the government. Throwing waste at inappropriate locations should be avoided. Efforts should be made to reduce vehicular emissions by encouraging the use of Public transport, carpooling and finding greener alternatives to the existing fuel. Encouraging the use of Renewable sources of energy will go a long way in making our planet a safe and healthy place to live in.  We have so far seen the significance of waste management. \"\"\"\n","text530 = f\"\"\"Metals and Nonmetals are different types of materials present around us. Elements can be divided into metals and nonmetals and it is important to know whether a particular element is a metal or nonmetal. Metals (like copper and aluminium) are good conductors of heat and electricity, while nonmetals (such as phosphorus and sulfur) are insulators. Materials are distinguished as above, based on their properties. The Majority elements in the periodic table are metals. This includes alkali metals, transition metals, lanthanides, actinides and alkaline earth metals. Metals are separated by nonmetals on a periodic table through a zigzag line starting from carbon, till radon. The elements between the two are phosphorus, selenium and iodine.  These elements and elements right to them in the periodic table are nonmetals. Elements present just to the left of the line are termed as semimetals or metalloids. These will have the combined properties of both metals and nonmetals. Non-metals occupy the upper right-hand portion of the periodic table. Considering the properties of non-metals it is not shiny, malleable or ductile nor are they good conductors of electricity. These properties of non-metals provide one means by which we can distinguish metals from non-metals.  Properties of Non-metals have less in common with each other than metals. Their physical and chemical properties vary widely. Some non-metals are solids and some are gases at room temperature. What are Non metals?  Very few elements in the periodic table are non-metals. These are present on the right-hand side in the periodic table. Elements that come under non-metals are sulphur, carbon, all halogens, phosphorus, hydrogen, oxygen, selenium, nitrogen and noble gases.  In the periodic table, non-metals are located left of the halogens and to the right of the metalloids. Since noble gases and halogens are also non-metals, these elements are often referred to as non-metals. Properties of Metals  Physical Properties of Metals  Some physical properties of metals are listed below.      Shiny (lustrous) in nature     Metal is a good conductor of electricity and heat     Density and melting point is high     Mouldable (Malleable)     Ductile     At room temperature, it is in solid form except for mercury     Opaque  Chemical Properties of Metals  Some chemical properties of metals are listed below.      Easily corrodible     Can lose electrons     Form basic oxides     Have low electronegativities     Good reducing agents  Properties of Non-Metals Physical Properties of Non-metals  Some physical properties of non-metals are listed below.      Poor conductors of electricity and heat     Non-Ductile metals     Brittle solids     Maybe solids, liquids or gases at room temperature     These are not sonorous     Transparent  Chemical Properties of Non-metals  Some chemical properties of non-metals are listed below.      The number of electrons in the outer shell is generally 4-8     Easily gain or lose valence electrons     Form acidic oxides whenever they come in contact with oxygen     High electronegative elements     Great oxidizing agents  Non-metals and metals take different forms (allotropes). They have different shapes and properties. Allotropes are elements that exist in two or more than two different physical forms.      Example 1: A non-metal carbon – two allotropes of carbon are diamond and graphite.     Example 2: A metal such as iron – two allotropes of iron are austenite and ferrite  Have a look at the given table depicting the major differences between Metals And Non-metals for better understanding.\"\"\"\n","text570 = f\"\"\"A matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Pen, paper, clips, sand, air, ice, etc. are different forms of matter. Every matter is made up of tiny particles. These particles are so tiny that they can’t be seen with naked eyes. Let’s learn about the different characteristics of particles of matter. Characteristics of Particles of Matter  As mentioned earlier, every substance is made up of particles. These particles exhibit some characteristics. They can influence the state and properties (physical and chemical) of a substance. The three characteristics shown by particles of matter are as follows. Particles Have Space Between Them  There are small voids between every particle in a matter. This characteristic is the concept behind the solubility of a substance in other substances. Let’s try to understand this with an illustration.  Take a glass of water. Put a teaspoon of salt/sugar and mix them properly. You will observe that the water is still clear. This is because the particles of salt/sugar get into the interparticle spaces between the water particles. This proves that there are voids between particles of a substance.  If you add more salt/sugar, it will dissolve until all the space between water particles gets filled. Particles Are Constantly in Motion (or) Particles are Continuously Moving  Particles of the matter show continuous random movements. The kinetic energy they possess helps them in this movement.  The spreading of ink in a beaker of glass, the smell that comes from agarbattis, etc. are few illustrations that show the movement of particles of a substance. When the particles of two different types of matter intermix on their own, the phenomenon is called diffusion. The diffusion of particles becomes fast when the temperature is increased. A rise in temperature increases the kinetic energy of the particles, making them move more vigorously. Particles Attract Each Other  Take an iron rod, a stick of chalk, and a pen. Try to break each one of these. Which one of these is easy to break? The iron rod is stronger than the other two items. What makes an item stronger? Yes, it’s the particles in them which are held by the inter-particle force of attraction.  In every substance, there is an inter-particle force of attraction acting between its particles. To break something we need to overcome this force.  The strength of the force differs from one substance to another.  The inter-particle force of attraction and the kinetic energy of the particles primarily determine the physical state of any matter. Physical Properties Of Matter  Since a long time, scientists have been researching about chemical and physical properties of matter. In simple terms, they define matter as something which has mass and occupies space (that is volume). Hence, everything we see around us is matter. For example, stars that twinkle, the sun that shines, the food we eat, bricks we used to make buildings, water in oceans and rivers, rocks that form mountains, etc. All of these can be brought under a single umbrella called matter. But does all the matter that we see exhibit the same physical properties? Obviously not, a block of wood is continuous while sand particles are coarse. Similarly, salt particles are soluble in water while sand particles are not. All these properties are known as physical properties.    Some physical properties of matter are      All matter has mass and occupies some space.     They can be broken into millions of tiny pieces further.  \"\"\"\n","\n","\n","# Physics\n","text575 = f\"\"\"When a ray of light approaches a smooth polished surface and the light ray bounces back, it is called the reflection of light. The incident light ray that land on the surface is reflected off the surface. The ray that bounces back is called the reflected ray. If a perpendicular were drawn on a reflecting surface, it would be called normal. The figure below shows the reflection of an incident beam on a plane mirror.  Here, the angle of incidence and angle of reflection are with respect to normal and the reflective surface. Laws of Reflection  The laws of reflection determine the reflection of incident light rays on reflecting surfaces, like mirrors, smooth metal surfaces and clear water. Let’s consider a plane mirror as shown in the figure above. The law of reflection states that      The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal all lie in the same plane     The angle of incidence = Angle of reflection  . Types of Reflection of Light  Different types of reflection of light are briefly discussed below:      Regular reflection is also known as specular reflection     Diffused reflection     Multiple reflection  Regular/ Specular Reflection  Specular Reflection refers to a clear and sharp reflection, like the ones you get in a mirror. A mirror is made of glass coated with a uniform layer of a highly reflective material such as powder. This reflective surface reflects almost all the light incident on it uniformly. There is not much variation in the angles of reflections between various points. This means that the haziness and the blurring are almost entirely eliminated. Diffused Reflection  Reflective surfaces other than mirrors, in general, have a very rough finish. This may be due to wear and tear such as scratches and dents or dirt on the surface. Sometimes even the material of which the surface is made of matters. All this leads to a loss of both the brightness and the quality of the reflection.  In the case of such rough surfaces, the angle of reflection when compared between points is completely haphazard. For rough surfaces, the rays incident at slightly different points on the surface is reflected in completely different directions. This type of reflection is called diffused reflection and is what enables us to see non-shiny objects. Multiple Reflection  A single image is formed when an object is placed in front of a mirror. What happens if we use two mirrors? Since reflective surfaces such as mirrors are very good at preserving the intensity of light in a reflection, a single light source can be reflected multiple times. These multiple reflections are possible until the intensity of light becomes low to the point that we cannot see. This means that we can have almost infinite multiple reflections. We can also see an image in every individual reflection. This means that each image is the result of an image or an image of an image.  The number of images we see depends on the angle between the two mirrors. We see that as we go on decreasing the angle between the mirrors, the number of images increases. And when the angle becomes zero, i.e., when the mirrors become parallel, the number of images becomes infinite. This effect can be easily observed when your barber uses another smaller mirror to show you the back of your head. When this happens, not only do you see the back of your head, but you also see innumerable images of yourself. \"\"\"\n","text500 = f\"\"\"What Is an Electric Charge?  Atoms are the building blocks of the universe. Whatever you see around you can be divided into smaller and smaller parts until you finally reach a part you cannot divide further. This building block is what we call an Atom. Inside an atom are protons, electrons and neutrons. Out of the three, electrons and protons fit the definition of an electric charge. The protons are positively charged, the electrons are negatively charged, and the neutrons are neutral. A majority of the mass of the atom is concentrated in a very tiny space in the centre called the nucleus and the electrons revolve around this heavy nucleus.  This means that electrons are held very loosely compared to protons. Therefore, the movement of charges here will be restricted to the movement of electrons. Since the atoms are made up of protons and electrons, we can safely conclude that all things are made up of electric charges. The charge of one proton is equal in strength to the charge of one electron. When the number of protons in an atom equals the number of electrons, the atom itself has no overall charge, it is neutral. Static Electricity  Static electricity refers to an imbalance between the electric charges in a body, specifically the imbalance between the negative and the positive charges on a body. The imbalance in the charge is introduced by physical means. One of the most common causes of static electricity is contact between solid objects. It was mentioned earlier that the movement of protons is not possible and the only movement of electric charge seen in static electricity is electrons.  Electrons in materials are held extremely loosely meaning that they can be exchanged through simple contact like rubbing. The image below is an example of rubbing a glass rod with silk which causes static electricity. When two objects are rubbed together to create static electricity, one object gives up electrons and becomes more positively charged while the other material collects electrons and becomes more negatively charged. We should keep in mind that the rules such as like charges repel and unlike charges attract is applicable here. Speaking of times when your hair seems to stand on its ends when you remove your cap. Static electricity is the culprit here as well. As you remove your hat, electrons are transferred from hat to hair, creating that interesting hairdo! Remember, objects with the same charge repel each other. Because they have the same charge, your hair will stand on end. Your hair is simply trying to get as far away from each other as possible! The same is true for when you comb your hair repeatedly with a comb. If you bring a comb you have used close to small bits of paper you will see that the comb attracts the pieces of paper. The comb loses electrons while rubbing your hair and this charge imbalance creates static electricity which then attracts the small bits of paper. \"\"\"\n","text823 = f\"\"\"Magnets are classified into two groups natural and artificial magnets based on how they achieved their magnetism and for how long they retain their magnetic abilities and on their magnetic field. Natural magnets occur in nature and are much weaker than artificial magnets.      Natural magnets – Natural magnets occur in nature and have a weak magnetic field. Lodestones are a common example of natural magnets.     Artificial magnets – Artificial magnets can be produced by man-made means and have a stronger magnetic field. They can also be shaped as required. When an artificial magnet is shaped in the form of a bar, it is called a bar magnet.  What Is Bar Magnet?  A bar magnet is a rectangular piece of an object, made up of iron, steel or any other ferromagnetic substance or ferromagnetic composite, that shows permanent magnetic properties. It has two poles, a north and a south pole such that when suspended freely, the magnet aligns itself so that the northern pole points towards the magnetic north pole of the earth. Types of Bar Magnet  There are two types of bar magnets:      Cylindrical bar magnet: A cylindrical rod is also known as a rod magnet that has a thickness equal to larger than the diameter enabling high magnetism property. These bar magnets find application in educational, experimental, and research uses.     Rectangular bar magnet: Rectangular bar magnets find applications in manufacturing and engineering industries as they have magnetic strength and field greater than the other magnets.   Properties of Bar Magnet  A bar magnet has properties similar to any permanent magnet.      It has a north pole and a south pole at two ends. Even if you break a bar magnet from the middle, both the pieces will still have a north pole and a south pole, no matter how many pieces you break it in.       Its magnetic force of it is the strongest at the poles.     If this magnet is suspended freely in the air with a thread, it will not come to rest until the poles are aligned in a north-south position. A Mariner’s Compass uses this property to determine direction.     If two bar magnets are placed close to each other, their unlike poles will attract and like poles will repel each other.     A bar magnet will attract all ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel and cobalt.  Magnetic Field Lines around a Bar Magnet  Let us understand the concept of magnetic field lines using the following activity. Let us sprinkle iron filings on a sheet of paper and a bar magnet in between. The magnetic field lines can be defined as imaginary lines that can be drawn along the magnetic field that is acting around any magnetic substance. The magnetic field lines possess certain properties,      The magnetic field lines of a magnet form continuous closed loops.     The tangent to the field line at any point represents the direction of the net magnetic field B at that point.     The larger the number of field lines crossing per unit area, the stronger the magnitude of the magnetic field B.     The magnetic field lines do not intersect.   How Are Electromagnets Different from Bar Magnets?  Though electromagnets and bar magnets show similar magnetic fields but the following are the differences between them:      Most bar magnets are blocks of ferromagnetic materials while electromagnets are coils of wire which sometimes are surrounded by a ferromagnetic core. Electromagnets behave like bar magnets when an electric current is passed through them.     Bar magnets generate their own magnetic field while electromagnets depend on the external sources of electric current for the generation of the magnetic field.     Bar magnets have a constant magnetic pull as they are permanent magnets while electromagnets do not have a constant magnetic pull as they are controlled by external sources of electric current.     The magnetic force of the bar magnet is constant and is dependent on the material it is made from while the magnetic force of an electromagnet can be varied by varying the amount of electricity flowing through the coil.  Uses of Bar Magnet      Bar magnets are used as stirrers in laboratories for magnetic experiments.     They also find applications in medical procedures.     Electronic devices such as telephones, radios, and television sets use magnets.     Many industries use bar magnets for the collection of loose metals and also for retaining the magnetism of other magnets.  What Is Pole Strength?  Pole strength is defined as the strength of a magnetic pole to attract magnetic materials towards itself.  Pole strength is a scalar quantity.  Alnico and Neodymium Bar Magnet  It will be incomplete to talk about bar magnets and not mention an Alnico bar magnet and a neodymium bar magnet. The primary components of Alnico magnets are aluminium, nickel, cobalt, and iron. These magnets produce a strong magnetic field and retain their magnetic property even under extreme heat. Neodymium bar magnets are made with a mixture of neodymium, boron, and iron. These are both extremely powerful magnets but very brittle.\"\"\"\n","text480 = f\"\"\"What Is Earth’s Magnetic Field  Earth’s magnetic field is also referred to as the geomagnetic field. The earth’s magnetic field extends millions of kilometers into outer space and looks very much like a bar magnet. The earth’s south magnetic pole is actually near the North Pole and the magnetic north pole is in Antarctica! This is why a compass magnet’s north pole actually points north (north and south poles attract). The Earth’s magnetic field extends far and wide but is very weak in terms of field strength. A mere 40,000 nT compared to a refrigerator magnet which has a strength of 10.  The Earth’s magnetic field extends far and wide but is very weak in terms of field strength. A mere 40,000 nT compared to a refrigerator magnet which has a strength of 107 nT!. Theory of Earth’s Magnetism  There is one theory that explains how the earth’s magnetism is caused:      Dynamo effect: The earth gets its own magnetic field lines because of the presence of the metallic fluids that are present at the outer core as well as in the inner core. The outer core consists of molten iron, while the inner core has the solidified elements.  What Causes Earth’s Magnetism?  Earth’s Magnetism is generated by convection currents of molten iron and nickel in the earth’s core. These currents carry streams of charged particles and generate magnetic fields. This magnetic field deflects ionising charged particles coming from the sun (called solar wind) and prevents them from entering our atmosphere. Without this magnetic shield, the solar wind could have slowly destroyed our atmosphere preventing life on earth to exist. Mars does not have a strong atmosphere that can sustain life because it does not have a magnetic field protecting it.  The earth’s magnetic poles are not aligned to the actual geographic north and south poles. Instead, the magnetic south pole is in Canada while the magnetic north pole lies in Antarctica. The magnetic poles are inclined by about 10 degrees to the earth’s rotational axis. So, all this time your compass was really pointing to Canada, not the true North!  Components of Earth’s Magnetic Field  There are three components that are responsible for the magnitude as well as the direction of the earth’s magnetic field:      Magnetic declination     Magnetic inclination or the angle of dip     Horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field  Magnetic Declination  The magnetic declination is defined as the angle between the true north and the magnetic north. On the horizontal plane, the true north is never at a constant position and keeps varying depending upon the position on the earth’s surface and time. Magnetic Inclination  The magnetic inclination is also known as the angle of dip. It is the angle made by the horizontal plane on the earth’s surface. At the magnetic equator, the angle of dip is 0°, and at the magnetic poles, the angle of dip is 90°. \"\"\"\n","text277 = f\"\"\"Paramagnetism is a kind of magnetism where several objects are attracted through an externally applied magnetic field. Whereas the diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and develop induced magnetic fields in the direction which is opposite to that of the applied magnetic fields. What is Paramagnetism?  The paramagnetic material becomes a good magnetic material when placed in the strong magnetic material. It acts as a magnet which attracts and repels other magnetic and ferromagnetic materials. When the magnetic field is removed, the total magnetic alignment of the magnetic dipoles is lost and the dipole is returned to its normal random motion. This condition is known as Paramagnetism.  These materials include most of the chemical elements and some compounds as they have a magnetic permeability greater than or equal to 1. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear to the strength and weakness of the field. It usually needs a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and different modern measurements on paramagnetic materials that are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer. Super Paramagnetism  Super Paramagnetism is described as the property as some materials magnetic moments change their direction at the nanoscale and behave like a paramagnet event. According to Curie’s law, If there is no magnetic field applied, curie temperature is applied at the same time as they show high magnetic susceptibility. Curie’s Law  According to this law, the magnetization in the paramagnetic material is inversely proportional to the temperature, which means the more the temperature of the paramagnetic material increases, its magnetization decreases.  M = C(B/T)  Where,  C = Curie constant  T = temperature in Kelvin and  B = applied magnetic field. \"\"\"\n","text472 = f\"\"\"Permanent Magnets  The magnetic field is produced by objects known as magnets. When these properties of magnetism are not lost throughout time it’s known as a permanent magnet. Magnetism is shown by ferromagnetic material as well. Some materials are a few alloys of iron and nickel. The way the domains are oriented in a ferromagnetic substance depends on the property of magnetism. The magnetic fields that are produced individually cancel themselves out when the domains are randomly oriented. A collective magnetic field can be produced by reducing the randomization of the domain by influencing it by an electrical field. This is one of the processes through which electromagnets are produced. But if the domains are already arranged such that they point in the same direction, even without an external influence they will produce a collective magnetic field. These are permanent magnets. Magnetic Behaviour  When imposing a magnetizing field on ferromagnetic substances the domains get arranged to produce magnetism and do not go back to their normal state. When the driving field is zero and even then the domains have not rearranged themselves to normalcy the time the substance takes to demagnetize or remains magnetised for is known as remanence. If we try to put the magnetic property back to zero by applying a field in an opposite direction the amount of that reverse field that’s required to demagnetise that substance is known as coercivity. The lack to retain the magnetic property of a substance is known as hysteresis.  Have you ever noticed that an iron nail which has been attached to a magnet for some time attracts other non-magnetic iron nails for a short span even after it has been detached from the magnet? This is because the domains of the iron nail had been reoriented. This effect is weak and is lost pretty soon. Therefore, an iron nail will not be considered as a permanent magnet.  The main advantage of a permanent magnet over any other type is that it does not need a continuous supply of external energy (in the case of electromagnets, electricity) to exhibit magnetism. For example, permanent magnets are used as compass needles. Example of Permanent Magnets  An everyday example of a permanent magnet is a refrigerator magnet. The image below shows the magnetic field produced by a bar magnet. The magnetic field is the sphere of influence of the magnet.  This can be visualised by sprinkling iron filings on a bar magnet. The filings will arrange themselves on the magnetic field lines of the magnet used. The strength of different magnets can be seen physically in this way.  This can be visualised by sprinkling iron filings on a bar magnet. The filings will arrange themselves on the magnetic field lines of the magnet used. The strength of different magnets can be seen physically in this way.\"\"\"\n","text700 = f\"\"\"When we talk about motion or rest, it is with reference to some point known as the origin. So, now with respect to the change in the position, we have two quantities which can be used to describe that change in position. They are distance and displacement. So now the question is, what is the difference between the two? Talking about distance is defined as the total path length covered during the motion. It can be represented only by magnitude. On the other hand, displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions. It requires both magnitude and direction for complete representation. What Is Motion?  We can define motion as the change of position of an object with respect to time. A book falling off a table, water flowing from the tap, rattling windows, etc., all exhibit motion. Even the air that we breathe exhibits motion! Everything in the universe moves. We live in a universe that is in continual motion. The fundamental particle of matter, that is, the atom, is in constant motion too. Every physical process in the universe is composed of motion of some sort. The motion can either be swift or slow, but motion exists. It is important that we give due attention to the study of motion because of its importance in the physical world. Motion is mainly described in terms of the following terms:      Distance     Displacement     Speed     Time  As discussed earlier, distance and displacement are used to describe the change in position. Now, if someone asks what the distance between A and B is, we can’t give a definite answer because it depends on the path taken. It may or may not be the same for all three paths. But for displacement, we can always give a definite answer as it is a straight line joining the two points. In other words, displacement is nothing but the shortest distance between the two points, which in this case is Path 2. Also, it has a particular direction from A to B, as we can see.  So now that we have a basic idea of both, we will try to solve an example: Suppose the distance between two cities, A and B, is ‘d’. A person goes from A to B and returns. Calculate distance travelled and displacement. Distance travelled = Total path length covered  = d + d  = 2d  Displacement is measured as the shortest distance between the initial and final position. In this case, both are the same, and hence, displacement is also zero. Types Of Motion  We might have noticed that different objects move differently. Some objects move in a curved path, some in a straight path and a few others in a different way. According to the nature of the movement, motion is classified into three types as follows:      Linear Motion     Rotary Motion     Oscillatory Motion  Linear Motion  In linear motion, the particles move from one point to another in either a straight line or a curved path. The linear motion depending on the path of motion, is further divided as follows      Rectilinear Motion – The path of the motion is a straight line.     Curvilinear Motion – The path of the motion is curved.  A few examples of linear motion are the motion of the train, football, the motion of a car on the road, etc. Rotatory Motion  Rotatory motion is the motion that occurs when a body rotates on its own axis.  A few examples of the rotatory motion are as follows:      The motion of the earth about its own axis around the sun is an example of rotary motion.     While driving a car, the motion of wheels and the steering wheel about its own axis is an example of rotatory motion.  Oscillatory Motion  Oscillatory motion is the motion of a body about its mean position. A few examples of  oscillatory motion are      When a child on a swing is pushed, the swing moves to and fro about its mean position.     The pendulum of a clock exhibits oscillatory motion as it moves to and fro about its mean position.     The string of the guitar when strummed moves to and fro by its mean position resulting in an oscillatory motion. \"\"\"\n","text780 = f\"\"\"What Is Sound?  A sound is a form of energy, just like electricity, heat or light. Sound is one of the important senses of the human body. Some sounds are pleasant, and some are annoying. We are subjected to various types of sound all time. Sound waves are the result of the vibration of objects. Let’s examine some sources of sounds like a bell. When you strike a bell, it makes a loud ringing noise. Now, instead of just listening to the bell, put your finger on the bell after you have struck it. Can you feel it vibrating? This is the key to sound. It is even more evident in guitars and drums. You can see the wires vibrating every time you pluck it. When the bell or the guitar stops vibrating, the sound also stops.  The to and fro motion of the body is termed vibration. You can see examples of vibrations everywhere. Vibrating objects produce sound. Some vibrations are visible; some aren’t. If you pull and then release a stretched rubber band, the band moves to and fro about the central axis and while doing, so it also produces a sound. The sound moves through a medium by alternately contracting and expanding parts of the medium it is travelling through.      In physics, the sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. Sound Wave Characteristics  After understanding what is sound, let us study the characteristics of the sound wave. The distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs is termed as the wavelength of the wave or the period. The number of cycles per unit time is termed as the frequency of the sound. Frequency is measured in cycles per second or Hertz.  The faster an object vibrates, i.e. the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch of the sound. The difference between the voices of a man and a woman must be clearly evident to you. The voice of a man has a lower frequency which contributes to the deepness of the bass in the voice. Women, in contrast, have a voice with higher frequency resulting in a higher shrillness or pitch. Closing Our Ears When We Hear Loud Noise  If you hear a very loud sound, what do you do? You cover your ears. How do you think that helps? When you cover your ears, you shut off the air inside your ears from the rest of the atmosphere. The sound waves travelling around you are now unable to get through to your ear or the intensity of the sound you hear is greatly reduced. Blocking your ears creates a discontinuity in the medium due to which the flow of sound energy is disturbed. Through this, we can make a very important observation; Sound waves rely on the medium for propagation. The propagation of the sound wave is not possible through the vacuum. The medium here can be gas, liquid or solid. The speed of sound when it is travelling through a medium depends on the type of medium. The speed of sound when travelling through air is 343 m/s or 1,235 km/h. Speed of Sound  The speed of a sound wave is affected by the type of medium through which it travels. Sound waves travel the fastest in solids due to the proximity of molecules. Likewise, sound waves travel slowest in gases because gases are spread far apart from one another. The state of the medium through which sound travels is not the only factor that affects a sound’s speed. The speed of a sound wave can also be affected by the density, temperature, and elasticity of the medium through which the sound waves travel. Can Sound Travel in Space?  A medium is essential for the propagation of sound. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because there are no molecules that can be compressed and expanded in space. Our voice is produced by the vibration of strings known as the vocal cords which are inside Adam’s apple. When you make a sound, its vibration travels through the air, and when it reaches your brain through your ears, it is interpreted as sound. In this case propagation of sound takes place through the air medium. How your brain and ear decode pressure variation in sound waves into sound is fascinating! Human Hearing and Speech  Humans can hear sounds ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Sounds with frequencies above the range of human hearing are called ultrasound. Sounds with frequencies below the range of human hearing are called infrasound. The typical sound produced by human speech has frequencies in the order of 100 to 1,000 Hz.\"\"\"\n","text777 = f\"\"\"What Is Energy?  There are different forms of energy on earth. The sun is considered the elemental form of energy on earth. In physics, energy is considered a quantitative property that can be transferred from an object to perform work. Hence, we can define energy as the strength to do any kind of physical activity. Thus, in simple words, we can define energy as,      Energy is the ability to do work  According to the laws of conservation of energy, “ energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another”. The SI unit of energy is Joule.  Units of Energy  The International System of Units of measurement of energy is joule. The unit of energy is named after James Prescott Joule. Joule is a derived unit equal to the energy expended in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one meter. However, energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as ergs, calories, British Thermal Units, kilowatt-hours, and kilocalories, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units. Different Types of Energy  Although there are many forms of energy, it is broadly categorized into:      Kinetic Energy      Potential Energy  . Kinetic Energy  Kinetic energy is the energy associated with the object’s motion. Objects in motion are capable of causing a change or are capable of doing work. To better understand, let us think of a wrecking ball. A wrecking ball in motion is used to do work such as the demolition of buildings, stones, etc. Even a slow-moving wrecking ball is capable of causing a lot of damage to another object, such as an empty house. However, a wrecking ball that is not in motion does not do any work. Another example of kinetic energy is the energy associated with the constant, random bouncing of atoms or molecules. This is also known as thermal energy. The average thermal energy of a group of molecules is what we call temperature, and when thermal energy is transferred between two objects, it’s known as heat. Different Types of Kinetic Energy: Radiant energy      Radiant energy is the type of energy that travels by waves or particles. This energy is created through electromagnetic waves and is most commonly experienced by humans in the form of heat. Following are a few examples of radiant energy:     When you turn on an incandescent light bulb, it gives off two forms of energy. There is visible light and heat that is generated. Both these generated energies are a form of radiant energy.     Sunlight is an example of radiant energy.  Thermal Energy  Thermal energy is similar to radiant energy and is experienced in the form of heat or warmth. While radiant energy refers to waves or particles, thermal energy describes the activity level among the atoms and molecules in an object. This is the only difference between radiant energy and thermal energy. Some examples of thermal energy include:      The geothermal energy that comes from the decay of natural minerals and the volcanic action of the earth is an example of thermal energy.     When you heat up the pizza in the oven, you raise the pizza’s temperature. The molecules that make up the pizza move more quickly when the pizza is piping hot.     The warmth you feel emanating from the engine is an example of thermal energy.  Sound Energy  Humans experience the vibrations that reach the human ear as sound. The disturbance moves in the form of waves through a medium like air and reaches our eardrum. On reaching the eardrum, these vibrations are converted into electrical signals and sent to the brain, which we interpret as the sensation of sound. Electrical Energy  The flow of negatively charged electrons around a circuit results in electricity which we more commonly refer to as electrical energy. Mechanical Energy  Mechanical energy is the energy associated with the mechanical movement of objects. This type of energy can also be referred to as motion energy. Potential Energy  Potential energy is the energy stored in an object or system of objects. Potential energy can transform into a more obvious form of kinetic energy. Different Types Of Potential Energy Gravitational Potential Energy  Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its vertical position or height. A book on a high bookshelf has a higher gravitational potential energy than a book on the bottom bookshelf. Gravitational Potential Energy Examples      River water at the top of a waterfall     A book on a table before it falls     A car that is parked at the top of a hill .\"\"\"\n","text455 = f\"\"\"What is Force?  Force is an important concept as it influences motion. It can be defined as an interaction that changes the motion of an object if unopposed. But the simple definition of force is that it is the push or pull experienced by any object. Force is a vector quantity, thus it has both magnitude and direction. Therefore, one has to specify both the direction and the magnitude to describe the force acting on an object. Types of Force  By applying force, one can make an object at rest move. This application of force can be done either by touching the object or by without touching the object. Therefore, there are two types of forces:      Contact force     Non-contact force  Contact Force  The force that is applied to the objects by bringing them into contact. There are three types of contact forces:       Frictional force     Applied force     Normal force  Read More: Contact Force Non-Contact Force  The force which is applied to the body without coming in contact is known as non-contact force. Gravitational force is an example of non-contact force. Force: Push and Pull  For instance, force has been defined as an interaction that changes the motion of an object if unopposed. When this statement is examined closely, we see the role of push-pull in this. A force that changes the direction of an object towards you, would be a pull. On the other hand, if it moves away, it is a push. Sometimes, force is simply defined as a push or pull upon an object resulting from the object’s interaction with another object. Hence, any kind of force is basically a push or a pull. Spring and elastic are also types of forces. The moment you push against it, it tends to resist and react or spring back with the same magnitude. Push and Pull Examples  Push is defined as the force that is responsible for an object moving from the state of rest. Examples of push:      Pushing the trolley.     Pushing of the car when it breaks down.     Pushing the table from one place to another.  The pull is defined as the force that is responsible for an object moving from the state of rest but in the opposite direction when compared to the push. Examples of pull:      Pulling the curtain.     Dragging the box.     Opening of the door.  Whenever we consider a force in a given scenario, it can act as an internal as well as an external force depending on the system we have considered. This is how we have introduced this topic from the basics and it emphasizes the fact that we have to be careful about the system chosen whenever we are labelling a force as an internal or an external force. \"\"\"\n","\n","\n","# Biology\n","text805 = f\"\"\"All living organisms have certain common characteristics, such as breathing, growing, requiring nutrition, producing offspring, responding to stimuli, etc., that distinguish them from non-living things. There are certain vital processes that maintain homeostasis and proper functioning of the body, they are called life processes. These processes continue to occur even when we are sleeping or not performing any action. These processes are essential for all living organisms, including plants and animals. These life processes are nutrition, photosynthesis, transportation, metabolism, respiration, reproduction and excretion.  In this chapter, we will learn about the details of these processes occurring in plants, animals and human beings in particular. Life  Earth happens to be the only known planet having life. There are beings who live, die and become part of nature again. The living organism can be differentiated from the inanimate entities on various parameters of life processes. Life Process      The maintenance of living organisms is essential even if they are moving, resting or even sleeping.     The processes which together perform the function of maintenance of ‘life’ are called as life processes.     Nutrition, respiration, circulation, and excretion are examples of essential life processes.     In unicellular organisms, all these processes are carried out by a single cell.     In multicellular organisms, well-developed systems are present to carry out the processes.  Nutrition      The process of acquiring food that is needed for nourishment and sustenance of the organism is called nutrition.      There are two main modes of nutrition, autotrophic and heterotrophic.     Autotrophic nutrition is present in plants, algae and some bacteria. Organisms produce their own food using light energy or chemical energy through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, respectively.     Heterotrophic nutrition is present in bacteria, fungi and animals. They derive energy from organic compounds, such as animals eating plants or other animals for food.     Heterotrophic nutrition has subtypes such as holozoic, saprophytic and parasitic nutrition.  Autotrophic Nutrition      If an organism can nourish itself by making its own food using sunlight or chemicals such mode of nutrition is called as autotrophic nutrition.      Plants photosynthesize (use light energy) and are called photoautotrophs.     Few bacteria use chemicals to derive energy and are called chemoautotrophs.  Photosynthesis      Photosynthesis is an important process by which food is formed.     The plants make food using sunlight and water, which provides nourishment to other organisms and themselves.     Chlorophyll present in the green parts absorbs light energy.     This light energy is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.     Hydrogen is then used to reduce carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, typically glucose.     Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis and stomata to facilitate the intake of carbon dioxide.  The overall reaction occurring in photosynthesis is as follows:  6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2 . Stomata      Stomata are pores on the leaves that help in the exchange of gases.     They are mostly found on the underside of the leaf.     Each stoma is guarded by guard cells, which control the opening and closing of the pore.     The water content of the guard cells is responsible for their function.  Saprophytic Nutrition      Some organisms feed on dead and decaying organic matter. This mode of nutrition is called saprophytic nutrition.      The food is partially digested outside the body, and then it is absorbed.     E.g. Fungi are saprophytes.  Parasitic Nutrition      Some organisms feed at the expense of another organism and in turn cause harm. This is called the parasitic mode of nutrition.      These parasites live on the body or in the body of a host organism and derive the nutrients directly from the body of the host.     E.g. Leech is an ectoparasite while Ascaris is an endoparasite. Cuscuta is a parasitic plant.       Amoeba feeds by Holozoic mode of nutrition.     It engulfs the food particle using pseudopodia, the process is called phagocytosis.     The engulfed food gets enclosed in a food vacuole.     As the food vacuole passes through the cytoplasm, digestion, absorption, and assimilation, take place.     When the food vacuole opens outside, the egestion of undigested food takes place.  Nutrition in Paramoecium      Paramoecium also exhibits holozoic nutrition.     However, they have cilia that help them to engulf the food through the oral groove.     A food vacuole is created, enclosing the food.     It moves through the cytoplasm, the process is called cyclosis.     Food digested in the food vacuole is absorbed by the cytoplasm.     Undigested food is given out to a tiny pore called an anal pore or cytopyge.  Nutrition in Humans      Humans are omnivores, they can eat plant-based food as well as animal-based food.     Being more complex, humans have a very complicated nutrition system.     The digestive system has an alimentary canal and associated digestive glands, which together function to nourish the body.     There are five stages in human nutrition; Ingestion, Digestion, Absorption, Assimilation and Egestion.     Four stages i.e. ingestion, digestion, absorption and egestion, take place in the alimentary canal, while assimilation of food takes place in the whole body.  \"\"\"\n","text1101 = f\"\"\"Alimentary Canal      The alimentary canal in humans is a long tube of varying diameter.     It starts with the mouth and ends with the anus.     Oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine are the parts of the alimentary canal.  Mouth      It is the opening of the alimentary canal and helps in the ingestion of food.     The buccal cavity, which is present behind the mouth, is also commonly referred to as the mouth.     The buccal cavity has teeth and a tongue.     The set of teeth helps in the mastication of food.     The tongue has taste buds on it and thus helps in tasting the food.     The salivary glands also open in the buccal cavity and pour saliva, which initiates the process of digestion.  Teeth      Teeth are the hard structures present in the buccal cavity.     They help us to cut, shear and masticate the food we eat.     The vertical section of a tooth shows four layers enamel, dentine, cement and dental pulp.     Enamel is the outermost, shiny, highly mineralized and hardest part of the human body.     Dentine makes the bulk of the tooth and contains 70% inorganic salts.     Cement is present at the lining of a tooth and bony socket.     The dental pulp is the central soft part of a tooth and contains nerve endings, blood and lymph vessels along with connective tissue.     There are four types of teeth in humans, Incisors, canines, molars and premolars, each with a specific function.     Incisors cut the food, canines tear the food while molars and premolars crush it.     The dental formula in adult humans is 2:1:2:3.  Oesophagus & Stomach Oesophagus      The swallowed food passes into the oesophagus.     It is a muscular tube, about 25 cm long, with a sphincter (valve/opening) at each end.     Its function is to transport food and fluid, after being swallowed, from the mouth to the stomach.     Food is pushed down by peristaltic movements.  Stomach      The stomach is a thick-walled bag-like structure.     It receives food from the oesophagus at one end and opens into the small intestine at the other end.     The inner lining of the stomach secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and digestive juices.     Food is churned into a semi-solid mass in the stomach and is called chyme.     Enzymes present in gastric juice break down the food.     Hydrochloric acid helps in the partial digestion of proteins and also kills harmful bacteria.     The mucus secreted by the wall of the stomach resists the action of HCl on itself.  Small Intestine      The small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary canal, about 20 feet long in humans.     It has regions, the duodenum, the region which follows the stomach; the jejunum is the middle part; and the ileum is the later region which continues further into the large intestine.     The internal surface of the small intestine is folded into finger-like projections called villi.     A common pancreatic duct from the pancreas and liver opens into the duodenum.     Most of the chemical digestion and absorption takes place in the small intestine.  Large Intestine      The large intestine in humans is about 5 feet long.     It has two regions, the colon ( about 1.5 m) and the rectum (10 cm in length in the adult).     The region of the large intestine after the ileum is called the colon, while the last part is called the rectum.     Colon has three regions, ascending colon, transverse colon and descending colon.     At the base of the ascending colon, a small finger-like out-growth is seen and is called an appendix.     It houses many useful bacteria required for the digestion of food.     Rectum opens to the outside by the anus.     The anus has internal and external anal sphincters.  Peristalsis  A constant wave-like movement of the alimentary canal right from the oesophagus to the small intestine is called as peristalsis.      Muscles present in the wall of the alimentary canal are responsible for peristalsis.     This movement helps to push the food through the alimentary canal.  Digestive Glands      Several glands produce digestive juices that help in the digestion of food.     Salivary glands, gastric glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are a few to name.     Salivary glands secrete saliva, which initiates digestion in the mouth itself.     Gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach secrete hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin.     The liver secretes bile which is stored in the gallbladder. Bile helps in the digestion of fats.     The pancreas secretes many digestive enzymes, and its secretion is called pancreatic juice.     Enzymes like trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, and amylase are present in pancreatic juice.  Pancreas      The pancreas is a long, flat gland present behind the stomach in humans.     It is one of the major digestive glands and is of mixed nature, i.e. endocrine as well as exocrine.     As an endocrine organ, it secretes two hormones called insulin and glucagon which maintain the blood sugar level.     As an exocrine gland, it secretes pancreatic juice, which is nothing but a mixture of many digestive enzymes.     The digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas include trypsin and chymotrypsin, and proteases which digest proteins.     It also includes amylase, which digests the starch content of the food.     Pancreatic lipases are the pancreatic enzymes that help in the digestion of fats.  Holozoic Nutrition      The mode of nutrition in which animals take their food as a whole is called as holozoic nutrition.  In holozoic nutrition, food passes through five steps – ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation and egestion. Physiology of Digestion      Mechanical digestion of food takes place in the buccal cavity where teeth masticate the food, saliva gets mixed, and it turns into a bolus.     Digestion of starch starts in the buccal cavity itself, with the action of salivary amylase present in the saliva.     Salivary amylase converts starch into maltose.     In the stomach, the churning of food takes place due to the muscular contraction and relaxation of its wall. It breaks down the food into simpler substances.     Digestion of proteins starts in the stomach with the action of pepsin. Proteins are broken down into smaller fragments called peptides by the action of pepsin.     The bolus, after mixing with gastric juice, turns into a fine soluble form known as chyme.     Chyme enters the small intestine, where complete digestion takes place due to the action of various enzymes present in the pancreatic juice, bile and intestinal juice.     The digested food is completely absorbed by the villi and microvilli of the small intestine.     Undigested food then enters the large intestine.     The colon is responsible for the absorption of water and salts, whereas the rectum stores the undigested food temporarily before defaecation.  \"\"\"\n","text751 = f\"\"\"Digestive System in Other Animals      Digestive systems in different animals vary in structure and function.     The structure of the digestive system depends on the food habits of the animal.     The alimentary canal in herbivores is long as the cellulose content of their plant-based diet takes a long time to digest.     On the other hand, the alimentary canal of carnivorous animals is comparatively shorter because meat gets digested faster.  Anatomy of Digestive Tract      The alimentary canal in humans is approximately 30 feet (9m) long. It is also called the gastrointestinal tract.     It starts in the mouth and ends in the anus.     Between these two openings, the alimentary canal is a tube of varying diameter.     Oesophagus, stomach, small intestine (divided into three regions, duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and large intestine(having two regions, colon and rectum) are the parts of the alimentary canal.     Salivary glands, pancreas and liver act as major digestive glands.     Glands present in the wall of the stomach and small intestine also contribute to the digestion of food.  Role of HCl      Hydrochloric acid in the stomach is secreted by the gastric glands present in its wall.     the pH of gastric acid is usually between 1.5 to 3.5     This acid serves the following functions:         Converts inactive pepsinogen and pro-rennin into active pepsin and rennin, respectively.         Provides an acidic medium for protein digestion.         Kills bacteria entered through food and prevents infection.         Prevents putrefaction of food in the stomach.     A thick layer of mucus secreted by the mucous glands of the stomach prevents itself from the action of gastric acid.     Excess acid damages gastric mucosa and causes gastric and duodenal ulcers.  Salivary Glands      Salivary glands are the exocrine glands that secrete saliva, and through a system of ducts, it is poured into the mouth.     In humans, three major pairs of salivary glands are present, parotid, submandibular and sublingual.     In healthy individuals, between 0.5 to 1.5 litres of saliva is produced per day.     Saliva serves the following functions in the oral cavity:         It lubricates and protects the soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity         It also gives protection from dental caries         Saliva prevents microbial growth in the oral cavity.         Saliva can encourage soft tissue repair by decreasing clotting time and increasing wound contraction.         Saliva contains the enzyme amylase that hydrolyses starch into maltose and dextrin. Hence saliva allows digestion to occur before the food reaches the stomach.         Saliva acts as a solvent in which solid particles can dissolve and enter the taste buds located on the tongue.  Heterotrophic Nutrition      When an organism depends on others for food, such a mode of nutrition is called as a heterotrophic mode of nutrition.      These organisms depend on autotrophs for their nutritional requirements.     E.g. Animals which eat plants as their food are called herbivores.     Animals which eat other animals as their food are called carnivores.     Holozoic, saprophytic and parasitic nutrition are all types of heterotrophic nutrition.  Glandular Epithelium      Many small glands present in the inner layer of the stomach and intestine take part in the digestion of food.     These glands are present in the epithelial lining of the stomach and intestine.     The glands present in different regions of the stomach are called gastric glands.     They are responsible for the secretion of mucus, hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsinogen.     The glands present in the epithelial lining of the small intestine and large intestine are called intestinal glands.     Glands of the small intestine are responsible for the secretion of intestinal juice, also called succus entericus.     Intestinal juice contains hormones, digestive enzymes, alkaline mucus, and substances to neutralize hydrochloric acid coming from the stomach.     Intestinal juice completes the digestion started by the pancreatic juice.     Glands of the large intestine are associated with the absorption of water and electrolytes.  Villi and Micro Villi      Complete digestion and absorption of food take place in the small intestine.     Pancreatic juice coming from the pancreas, bile from the liver and intestinal juice secreted by the intestinal glands complete the digestion of food material.     All the digested nutrients are absorbed by the long finger-like projections present in the ileum of the small intestine.     These small finger-like projections of the inner wall of the intestine are called villi (singular: villus).     Each villus has its cell membrane of the lumen side again folded into microscopic processes called microvilli.     Villi increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls making available a greater surface area for absorption.     Digested nutrients pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion.     Villi also help in the chemical digestion of food by secreting digestive enzymes.  \"\"\"\n","text340 = f\"\"\"     The liver is the largest and major digestive gland of humans     The liver, in humans, is located in the upper right-hand portion of the abdomen.     This organ is dark reddish-brown in colour due to an extensive blood supply.     Some of the important functions of the liver are as follows:         It secretes bile which helps in digestion.         It filters the blood coming from the digestive tract before passing it to the rest of the body.         It detoxifies various metabolites and antidotes.         The liver makes proteins important for blood clotting and other functions.         It stores and releases glucose as needed.         It processes haemoglobin from the dead and worn-out RBCs, for the iron content (the liver stores iron).         The conversion of harmful ammonia to urea takes place in the liver.  Digestive Juices      Pancreatic juice, bile and intestinal juice (succus entericus) are collectively called digestive juices.     A common duct from digestive glands pours the secretions into the duodenum.     Chyme enters the small intestine, where complete digestion takes place due to the action of various enzymes.     In the duodenum, the acidity of chyme is turned to alkalinity by the action of bile coming from the liver. This is necessary for pancreatic enzyme action.     Bile also emulsifies the fats into smaller globules.     Pancreatic and intestinal amylases break down carbohydrates into glucose.     Trypsin and chymotrypsin are the proteases responsible for the breakdown of proteins finally into amino acids.     Lipase is the enzyme which acts on the emulsified fats and breaks them down into glycerol and fatty acids.  Water Absorption in Large Intestine      The large intestine is not involved in the digestion of food or absorption of nutrients.     The major function of the large intestine is to absorb water from the remaining indigestible food matter and make the stool solid.     The large intestine also helps in the absorption of vitamins made by bacteria that normally live in the large intestine.     The innermost layer of the large intestine also acts as a barrier and protects from microbial infections and invasions.     Rectum stores the undigested food temporarily until defecation. \"\"\"\n","text403= f\"\"\"Respiration Introduction to Respiration      Respiration broadly means the exchange of gases.     Animals and plants have different means of exchange of gases.     At a cellular level, respiration means the burning of food to generate the energy needed for other life processes.     Cellular respiration may take place in the presence or absence of oxygen.  Respiration in Humans      The human respiratory system is more complex and involves breathing, the exchange of gases and cellular respiration.     A well-defined respiratory system helps with breathing and the exchange of gases.     Breathing involves the inhalation of oxygen and the exhalation of carbon dioxide.     The gaseous exchange takes place in the lungs, and oxygen is supplied to all cells of the body.     Cellular respiration takes place in each and every cell.  Respiratory System      The human respiratory system involves the nose, nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx, trachea/windpipe, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli.     Bronchioles and alveoli are enclosed in a pair of lungs.     The rib cage, muscles associated with the rib cage and diaphragm all help in the inhalation and exhalation of gases.     The exchange of gases takes place between an alveolar surface and surrounding blood vessels.     Alveoli provide a large surface area for the exchange of gases.  Physiology of Respiration      Breathing in humans is facilitated by the action of internal intercostal and external intercostal muscles attached to the ribs and the diaphragm.     When the dome-shaped diaphragm contracts and becomes flattened and the rib cage is expanded due to the action of intercostal muscles, the volume of the lungs increases, pressure there drops down and the air from outside gushes in. This is inhalation.     To exhale, the diaphragm relaxes and becomes dome-shaped again; the chest cavity contracts due to the action of intercostal muscles, the volume inside the lungs decreases, pressure increases and the air is forced out of the lungs.     Inhaled air increases the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli,  so oxygen simply diffuses into the surrounding blood vessels.     Blood coming from cells has more concentration of carbon dioxide than outside air, and thus carbon dioxide simply diffuses out of the blood vessels into the alveoli.     Thus, breathing takes place due to the combined action of intercostal muscles and the diaphragm, while the exchange of gases takes place due to simple diffusion.  Inhalation and Exhalation      The process of taking in air rich in oxygen is called inhalation.     Similarly, the process of giving out air rich in carbon dioxide is called exhalation.     One breath comprises one inhalation and one exhalation.     A person breathes several times a day.     The number of times a person breathes in one minute is termed as his/her breathing rate. \"\"\"\n","text421 = f\"\"\"Diffusion      Diffusion is the movement of molecules from high concentration area to the low concentration area without spending any energy. Cellular Respiration      Cellular respiration is set of metabolic reactions occurring inside the cells to convert biochemical energy obtained from the food into a chemical compound called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).      Metabolism refers to a set of chemical reactions carried out to maintain the living state of the cells in an organism. These can be divided into two categories:     Catabolism – the process of breaking molecules to obtain energy.     Anabolism – the process of synthesizing all compounds required by the cells.     Therefore, respiration is a catabolic process which breaks large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy to fuel cellular activities.     Glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain are the important processes of cellular respiration.  Aerobic Respiration      Aerobic respiration is a process in which the food i.e. glucose is converted into energy in the presence of oxygen.      The general equation of aerobic respiration as a whole is given below-  Glucose + oxygen ⇒ Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy      This type of respiration takes place in animals, plants and other living organisms.  Respiration in Lower Animals      Lower animals lack a sophisticated respiratory system like lungs, alveoli etc.     Respiration in them takes place by simple exchange mechanisms.     Animals like earthworms take in gases through their skin.     Fishes have gills for gaseous exchange.     Insects have a tracheal system, which is a network of tubes through which air circulates and gaseous exchange takes place.     Frogs breathe through their skin when in water and through their lungs when on land.  Respiration in Muscles      Respiration in muscles can be anaerobic when there is not enough oxygen.     Glucose gets broken down into carbon dioxide and lactic acid.     This results in the accumulation of lactic acid that makes the muscles sore.     This type of anaerobic respiration is also known as lactic acid fermentation.  ATP      It is the energy currency of the cell.     ATP stands for Adenosine Tri-Phosphate.     This molecule is created.; as a result, reactions like photosynthesis, respiration etc.     The three phosphate bonds present in the molecule are high-energy bonds, and when they are broken, a large amount of energy is released.     Such released energy is then used for other metabolic reactions.  Respiration in Plants      Unlike animals and humans, plants do not have any specialized structures for gaseous exchange.     They have stomata (present in leaves) and lenticels (present in stems), which are involved in the exchange of gases.     Compared to animals, plant roots, stems, and leaves respire at a very lower rate.  \"\"\"\n","text328 = f\"\"\"     Transpiration is a biological process in which water is lost in the form of water vapour from the aerial parts of the plants.     This process occurs mainly through the stomata, where the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) occurs.     Transpiration helps in the transportation of water from roots to the upper parts of plants, and this is explained by the ‘transpirational pull theory’.     Loss of water, especially from leaves, acts as a straw effect and pulls water upwards from roots.     Transpiration also acts as an excretory mechanism in plants as it helps to get rid of excess water.       In unicellular organisms like amoeba exchange of gases takes place through a general body surface by osmosis.     In lower animals like an earthworm, the gaseous exchange takes place through their moist skin.     The requirement for oxygen is sufficiently met in these ways.     But as the animal starts becoming more and more complex, for example, humans, the requirement for oxygen cannot be met alone by diffusion.     Moreover, diffusion will not be able to supply oxygen to the deep-seated cells.     This difficulty has led to the evolution of a more complex mechanism of gaseous exchange, and that is the development of lungs.     The alveoli present in the lungs provide a large surface area required for the necessary gas exchange.  Transportation in Human Beings Transportation      All living organisms need a few necessary components like air, water, and food for their survival.     On a regular basis, animals ensure these elements by breathing, drinking and eating.     The required elements are transported to their body cells and tissues by a  transportation system.     In plants, the vascular tissue is responsible for transporting the substances.  Transportation in Humans      Transportation in humans is done by the circulatory system.     The circulatory system in humans mainly consists of blood, blood vessels and the heart.     It is responsible for the supply of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of carbon dioxide and other excretory products.     It also helps to fight infections.  \"\"\"\n","text457 = f\"\"\"Diversity in the living world is immense, with millions of species of organisms identified to date. The world that we live in is over 4.6 billion years old, and within that span of time, evolution has led to innumerable and spectacular biodiversity in the living world. But what exactly is “life”, and how is it defined?  Over the ages, the definition of “life” has been widely disputed, and often, life was attributed to characteristics such as movement, mobility and growth. At a certain point in history, plants were considered non-living. But today, we can tell apart all the organisms that we see into “living” and “non-living.” But when we delve deeper – into the microscopic scale, the line between the two is even more blurred. What is Living?  We do know that all living organisms reproduce, grow and metabolize. But when we look at the microscopic realm, the actual definition of life is rather blurred. For instance, viruses are basically nucleic acid that is protected by a protein coat. They exhibit no typical characteristics of living organisms, such as reproduction, until and unless it is inside a host.  Another “organism” that borders between the living and non-living are Prions. These are essentially misfolded proteins that can reproduce by making other healthy proteins misfold. These entities are responsible for causing diseases such as Spongiform Encephalopathy, and fatal familial insomnia, which are almost always fatal. In conclusion, the realm between the living and the non-living differs even now as the definition of “life” is ambiguous. Characteristics of Life  Living organisms exhibit undisputable signs of life – such as growth, reproduction and metabolism. Higher organisms such as humans showcase consciousness – where we become aware of our surroundings. Similarly, consciousness may be observable in many lower forms of life, such as bacteria and protozoa. When these organisms engulf food or react to their environment, it is done primarily to ensure survival. iversity in the Living World  In response to the sheer number of organisms discovered to date, a system of standardizing names was implemented. Binomial nomenclature assigns a two-part scientific name to an organism. Botanists and zoologists follow set principles and criteria when assigning a scientific name to an organism. For instance – plant names are assigned based on the principles and criteria set by the International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). Similarly, animal names are assigned on the basis of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN).  Classification of organisms according to the aforementioned conventions involved a hierarchy of steps, with each step representing a category or a rank. The most basic unit of classification is species.  A species is a group of individual organisms with fundamental similarities. \"\"\"\n","text951 = f\"\"\"What is a Cell?  A cell is defined as the most basic, structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Essentially, a cell is a structure that contains organelles which provide the necessary functions to sustain itself. However, not all cells are the same.  Plants have cells that are vastly different from animals. One of the primary differences between the two is the absence of cell walls in animal cells. Cells also vary in size, with the largest one in the human body being the egg or the female ovum. It measures roughly 1 millimetre across. The smallest cell is the granule cell which is found in the human cerebellum, measuring roughly around 4.5 micrometres in size. Cell Theory  This scientific theory, initially formulated by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, proposed that all living organisms are composed of cells, and new cells are formed from pre-existing cells. Even though the theory was put forth by Schleiden and Schwann, other notable scientists have contributed to this theory, turning its status from a theory to a universally accepted fact. Prokaryotic Cells  Prokaryotic cells are unicellular microorganisms and one of the most ancient organisms on earth. There are many types of prokaryotes, some of which are extremophiles. Others are photoautotrophic, able to produce nutrients from the energy of the Sun.  A typical prokaryotic cell is made up of a single membrane, and therefore, all the reactions occur within the cytoplasm. They can be free-living or can be found within the gut of other organisms, such as ruminants (cows and buffaloes). Eukaryotic Cells  Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells possess a nucleus enclosed within a membrane. All multicellular organisms are eukaryotic, and they fall under the domain of Eukaryota. Structurally, eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotic cells,  typically having a volume 10,000 times greater than prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells also possess many membrane-bound organelles devoted to various life functions. Cell Organelles  Eukaryotes possess many cellular organelles that perform various functions. Some of these organelles, such as the cell wall, are exclusive to plant cells.      Cell Membrane     Cell wall     Mitochondria     Plastids     Ribosomes     Cytoskeletons     Centrosome     Centrioles     Nucleus     Microbodies     Cilia and Flagella     Endomembrane systems which consist of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Plant cells have centrally placed vacuoles.  What is the Cell Cycle?  Essentially, the cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that occur before the cell actually divides and gives rise to new cells. This is a very important process and has varying implications from growth and development to repair of the organism. Mitosis  This is one of the two types of cell division where a single cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. In unicellular organisms, this type of cell division typically contributes to asexual reproduction. In multicellular organisms, mitosis is helpful for the growth and repair of damaged cells. Mitosis is also called equational division. Meiosis  Also called reduction division, meiosis is another type of cell division that commonly occurs during sexual reproduction. Here, the chromosomes in the parent cell reduce by half, forming four gamete cells which are genetically distinct from the parent cells. Meiosis is very significant has it provides genetic diversity among a population. When Cell Division Goes Wrong  Cells have many mechanisms that dictate when to divide and when to stop. When these mechanisms fail, the end result is usually cancer. Cells divide at the right time and at the right order. Such abnormalities can result in the chromosomes being damaged or destroyed. When cancer cells that are initially benign lose or gain faulty chromosomes, it can become malignant, often becoming life threating. What is Cytokinesis?  Cytokinesis is the process where the cytoplasm of a parental cell splits into two daughter cells. Moreover, the process occurs concurrently with meiosis and mitosis in animal cells.  Describe the quiescent phase of the cell cycle.  The quiescent phase refers to the G0 state where the cells reside in an inactive state (hence the term “quiescent”) before beginning with the cell cycle after activation in response to extrinsic signals.  What is mitosis?  Mitosis is a type of cell division where two daughter cells are formed possessing the same number and kind of chromosomes as their parent’s nucleus. It predominantly occurs during the growth of normal tissues.  What is the significance of meiosis?  Meiosis is very important because it ensures that the organisms which are born through sexual reproduction possess the correct number of chromosomes. If the number of chromosomes deviates from the standard, the organism may develop genetic abnormalities. What are Biomolecules?  All the carbon-based compounds that are found in or produced by organisms and are essential to a biological process are called biomolecules. Examples of biomolecules include proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. Even molecules such as metabolites (primary and secondary) are considered as biomolecules. Enzymes  Most enzymes discovered to date are proteins. There are even nucleic acids that exhibit characteristics of enzymes are called ribozymes. Enzymes are similar to proteins, wherein, it possesses a primary structure as well as secondary and tertiary structures.  In the simplest of sense, enzymes work on a “lock and key” basis (based on the model first postulated by the Emil Fischer.) The model takes the analogy that the lock is the enzyme and the substrate functions as the key.  A substrate is a molecule acted on by an enzyme, hence, only the correctly sized substrate will fit in the keyhole (an analogy for the active site) of the lock (or the enzyme in this case). Macromolecules  Macromolecules are very large molecules, usually consisting of thousands of atoms or more. Proteins and lipids are macromolecules that are found in living organisms. Synthetic macromolecules include plastics and carbon nanotubes.  According mammalian systems, there are three major types of macromolecules:      Carbohydrates     Proteins     Lipids     Nucleic Acids. \"\"\"\n","text1255 = f\"\"\"What Is Evolution?  Evolution is the study of the different forms of life, its characteristics and the changes over several generations. It is the scientific theory used by biologists to study the genetic variation in a population.  There are many theories about how life originated on the planet Earth. The theory of evolution is based on the idea that all species are correlated and progressively vary with time. Darwin’s Theory of Evolution  Charles Robert Darwin, an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, is well known for his theory of evolution and the process of natural selection. He gave the theory of evolution, which is known as ‘Darwin’s theory of natural selection’, and also published a book on “Origin of Species by Natural Selection”.  The main features of Darwin’s Theory are as follows,      All organisms reproduce and multiply enormously.     No two individuals are alike. They are different from each other either in size, shape, behaviour, etc.     Some traits are consistently passed on from their parent to the offspring.     The rate of reproduction varies in all living species. Some reproduce more and some minimum.  A Brief Account of Evolution  According to several theories of evolution:      The first cellular forms of life appeared on Earth about 2000 million years ago.     Later single-celled organisms, multicellular forms, and invertebrates were formed and became active.     Jawless fish evolved, and different organisms started to invade from water to land. Later, amphibians and reptiles, some of them viviparous mammals, came into existence.     About 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago, evolved primates that resembled today’s gorillas and chimpanzees. During the ice age between 75,000-10,000 years ago, modern Homo sapiens arose.  Evidence for Evolution      It indicates the paleontological evidence, which denotes that life forms have arisen at various instances in the Earth’s history, which covers fossils, rocks from sediments, etc.     Ernst Heckel proposed embryological support for evidence which was based upon the observation of some traits during the embryonic stages that persisted in all vertebrates that are not found in adults.     The proposal was disapproved by Karl Ernst von Baer as he noted that embryos do not go through the adult phases of other animals.     Divergent evolution is used to refer to the animals having the same structure developed along different directions as a result of adaptations to different needs. The structures are referred to as homologous, where homology represents common ancestry. Example – The tendrils and thorns of Cucurbita and Bougainvillea indicate homology.     Convergent evolution refers to different structures evolving for the same function, thereby having similarities. This is why analogous structures are a result of convergent evolution. Examples of analogy – Flippers of Dolphins and Penguins.     It was indicated that entities in a mixed population could adapt better, survive and cause an increase in the size of the population. But none of the variants got wiped out completely.     Examples of evolution by anthropogenic action are the appearance of resistant cells/entities in a time span of months or years as opposed to centuries.     Through this evidence, it was also indicated that evolution is not a directed process in the context of determinism; rather is a stochastic process basis the chance events in nature and chance mutations in entities.  Adaptive Radiation      It is referred to the process of evolution of various species in particular geographical regions right from the point and radiating literally to other geographical areas. Examples are Australian marsupials and Darwin’s finches.     Entities are better adapted to survive in an otherwise hostile environment as the adaptive ability is inherited, it being a genetic basis, whereas fitness is the outcome of the ability to adapt and hence getting selected by nature.     Two key concepts of the Darwinian theory of evolution are branching descent and natural selection.  Hardy-Weinberg Principle      This principle states that allele frequencies in a population are stable and are constant from generation to generation; the gene pool remains constant. This is referred to as genetic equilibrium, where the sum total of all allelic frequencies is 1.     In a diploid, let p and q represent the frequency of alleles A and a. The probability that an allele A with a frequency of p appears on both the chromosomes of a diploid individual is simply the product of the probabilities.     Five factors affecting the Hardy-Weinberg principle are – gene flow, genetic drift, genetic recombination, mutation and natural selection     When the original drifted population becomes founders, the effect is known as the founder effect.  Organisms  An organism refers to a contiguous living system that lives in an environment and has the ability to adapt and retain certain structures and behaviour. It includes fungi, bacteria, plants, animals, and humans. An organism collectively forms a population. The population forms a community which operates the ecosystem. The ecosystem consists of both biotic and abiotic factors.  Major abiotic factors which lead to variation in the physical and chemical conditions of different habitats are temperature, water, light, and soil. Organisms and Environment  All organisms possess the ability to adapt to different environmental conditions due to genetic variations. This increases their chances of survival. The polar bear has different character traits that help them to adapt to the extremely cold climate of Antarctica. The dense fur coats protect them from cold and predators. The waxy coat repels water and keeps the body warm. These features help them to adapt to the cold. Population  The population is defined as a group of individuals or organisms of any species living in a well–defined geographical area at a specific time with the capability of interbreeding. For example, the population of deer in a forest. Population Attributes      Birth rate – Total number of individuals born in a given period of time.     Death rates – Total number of deaths in a period of time.     Sex Ratio – Total number of females and males per 1000 individuals.     Age pyramid – A plot of age distribution.  Population Growth  Population growth refers to the increase in the number of individuals in a population. This depends on various factors such as weather, food availability, predator pressure, etc. The population density changes due to the following factors:      Natality: The number of births in a population in a given time period.     Mortality: The number of deaths in a population in a given time period.     Emigration: The number of individuals who moved to some other habitat in a certain time period.     Immigration: The number of individuals who have come into the habitat from elsewhere in a certain period of time.  Population Growth Models  The population growth models include:      Exponential Growth: With the limited supply of food, the population follows exponential growth.     Logistic Growth: When the resources are finite and become limited sooner or later, population growth is said to be logistic.  Population Interactions  This refers to the interaction between different populations. There are various modes of population interaction. These include: Predation  This is a type of interaction in which an organism kills and feeds on another organism. The one who kills is known as the predator and the one who is killed is the prey. Competition  This is the type of biological interaction between different animals or species in which both are harmed. Parasitism  Parasitism is a type of interaction between species in which the parasite lives inside the body of another organism and cause harm to it. Commensalism  In this type of interaction, one organism benefits while the other is neither benefitted nor harmed. Mutualism  In this type of interaction, both the species or organisms are benefitted from each other.\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8423,"status":"ok","timestamp":1700759654629,"user":{"displayName":"Shamsudheen SatMarks","userId":"10306487884837993737"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"WK5g5UdH6JgM"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install -q openai==0.27.0"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":775,"status":"ok","timestamp":1700759655381,"user":{"displayName":"Shamsudheen SatMarks","userId":"10306487884837993737"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"w8c_-WWL6Jgf"},"outputs":[],"source":["import json\n","import openai\n","\n","# Indbytes's API key\n","openai.api_key = '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'\n","\n","\n","# Personal API key\n","#openai.api_key = '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'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"D2zeYLjF6Jgj"},"outputs":[],"source":["# 0 for sentence and 1 to maths\n","\n","model = 0\n","text = text1255\n","MCQ = 5\n","Single_word = 5\n","Fill_blank = 3\n","Descriptive = 0\n","Difficulty = 'Medium'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9,"status":"ok","timestamp":1700762090441,"user":{"displayName":"Shamsudheen SatMarks","userId":"10306487884837993737"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"V9qZ-FLo6Jgn"},"outputs":[],"source":["# For Maths generation\n","\n","model = 1\n","text = 'Algebra'\n","MCQ = 5\n","Single_word = 3\n","Fill_blank = 5\n","Descriptive = 5\n","Difficulty = 'Easy'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DcVEi-Ow6Jgq"},"outputs":[],"source":["if model == 0:\n","  options = 'number of multiple choise questions = ' + str(MCQ) + ' ,number of single word answer type questions = ' +str(Single_word) + ' ,number of fill in the blank type questions = ' + str(Fill_blank) + ' ,number of descriptive type questions = ' + str(Descriptive) + ', and the difficulty level is = ' + str(Difficulty)\n","  input = f\"\"\"\n","Generate different types of questions from the given text delimited by triple backticks.\n","\n","Types of question to be generated are Multiple choice questions, Single word answer type, Fill in the blank type, and descriptive type.\n","In addition to the text, you will also be provided with options like below\n","\n","1.
